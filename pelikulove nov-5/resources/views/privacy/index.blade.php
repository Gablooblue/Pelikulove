                        <p>TWelcome to the Pelikulove community!
                        </p>


                        <p>Pelikulove exists to bring creative minds together and cultivate a creative community that is
                            inclusive, collaborative, progressive, and sustainable.</p>

                        <p> Through Filipino culture and the arts, our mission is to provide a space for new works and
                            new
                            perspectives where both artist and audience can interact with and learn from each other, and
                            develop their best creative selves with the right tools and the right mentors.</p>

                        <p>To build a sustainable community, we ask for you to participate in such a way that promotes a
                            respectful, friendly, and warm experience for our community.</p>

                        <p> Below is a list of our community guidelines, which fall under common sense and universal

                        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3"><b>Community Interaction</b></h4>

                        <p><b>Bots are on the rise!</b> Stay human and act online as how you would offline. Don’t do
                            unto others
                            what you don’t want done to you.</p>


                        <p>
                            <b>The world is getting more polarized.</b> Engaging in healthy discourse may bring out the
                            best
                            ideas
                            and lead us to the truth.</p>

                        <p> <b>The ego is fragile.</b> Give criticism constructively. Be specific and share where you’re
                            coming
                            from. Give clear suggestions, if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p> <b> Dinosaurs go extinct. </b> With technology constantly disrupting old values and old ways
                            of doing
                            things, let’s adapt a “growth mindset”. Persist through the setbacks and learn through
                            experience.</p>

                        <p> <b> It’s the age of post-truth.</b> Be critical. The information highway is at the tip of
                            your
                            fingers.
                            Take initiative and do research. Knowledge-sharing is key.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b> Art knows no age. </b> Only humans know limits and bounds. We believe you know what
                            you’re ready
                            for.
                            There are no graphic depictions of sex and violence here, only discussion for mature
                            audiences,
                            for intellectual discovery. We leave it up to your discernment and discretion.</p>

                        <p> <b>Malicious conduct is for trolls!</b> We have zero-tolerance for malicious, offensive, or
                            obscene
                            content or activity. This includes trolling, personal attacks such as ad hominem,
                            discrimination, insults, and vulgar posts or comments.
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>The internet can be dark and terrifying.</b> Find your tribe. Look for like-minded people
                            whom
                            you
                            can comfortably share ideas with, give honest feedback to, or even meet up with!</p>

                        <p> <b>Art is not just a gift.</b> It can save your sanity. It can save the world. If you
