00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:13.533
Good day!

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.848
This is a course on how to write a play.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:25.435
Not just any form of writing,
but writing a stage play.

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:29.466
Writing plays is different

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:37.244
compared to writing novels,
short stories, essays, and even poems.

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:46.707
However, playwriting actually
originated from poetry.

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:53.125
Although being a playwright today
means you're writing for the stage

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:58.609
and what you write
doesn’t have to be a poem,

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.968
still, it came from what's
known as dramatic poetry.

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:07.414
Generally, there are about
three types of poetry.

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:15.537
Narrative poetry is what
gave birth to various epics.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.003
Today, a biography could be
in poetry form.

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:23.372
Those are forms of narrative poetry.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.722
Another type is lyric poetry

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:31.934
which is given the most focus nowadays.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.902
Lyric poetry is our
popular notion of poetry.

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:39.267
When people say,
"You're too poetic,"

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:42.664
they usually refer to lyric poetry

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:46.063
where emotions or moments
are usually expressed.

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:53.548
In dramatic poetry,
dialogue is necessary.

00:01:53.791 --> 00:02:01.143
Like the dialogue between the ensemble
and the main character in Greek dramas.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.151
Eventually, it developed into
having two characters.

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:10.264
Back then, it was just the ensemble
and the main character interacting

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:13.617
until eventually,
other characters came into play.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:19.827
So it's focused on
what's being dramatized,

00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:21.852
but in poetry form.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:30.246
So all these types of poetry
were written to be performed.

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:36.415
It's different from
the later form of writing

00:02:36.607 --> 00:02:39.398
which is written to be read.

00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:43.818
Of course, today, we read the plays
that were written back then.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:48.236
But since there were no publishers
and printing presses before,

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:51.980
these plays needed to be performed.

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:55.456
Even if they wrote it down,
it could easily be destroyed or lost

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:58.727
maybe because only the writer
had a copy.

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:09.003
But essentially, these plays were written
not to be read but to be performed.

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:17.495
And this is where
we will be focusing

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:22.973
since its writing mechanics
are different.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:36.123
The basic unit of dramatic writing
is creating a scene.

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:38.975
Whether the writer
is conscious about it or not,

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:45.881
she has to put talking and
moving characters in a scene.

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:53.838
That’s the first thing I tell the participants
whenever I conduct workshops.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:59.695
Create a scene, whether you
understand the instructions or not,

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.998
based on your own understanding.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.027
Write a scene.
Don’t make a scene.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:08.066
Write a scene

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:14.044
to show me
how you understand it.

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:22.903
Don’t limit yourself
to creating a realistic scene.

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:30.334
Just write a scene according to how you know
what a scene should look like.

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:32.762
Simple. It has a beginning,
middle, and end.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.566
Write a scene.
Tell the story in that scene.

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:40.700
With or without dialogue,
it depends on how you understand it.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.764
That’s where we’ll dissect
what a scene looks like,

00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:50.172
what's in it,
and what it's leading up to.

00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:56.937
It's up to you if you want to have
one or more characters in your story.

00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:58.260
It's up to you.
