00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.890
- Does the premise
answer the question,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.850
“What’s this story about?”

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.447
Yes and not--

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.662
it doesn’t answer...

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.632
the question

00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:33.983
because there are a lot
of answers to that question.

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.321
For example,

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:38.501
it’s about a king

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:42.622
who keeps on longing
for something 'til death.

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:46.684
It’s a premise,
but it’s also about

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:51.973
destroying feudal values.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.518
That’s not the premise.

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:57.260
It just means I could have
a lot of answers to that question.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:00.382
But the answer is,
probably, dramaturgically,

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.127
to show you
the direction of the story,

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:04.438
that’s probably it.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.971
because it could be about...

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:14.740
 disloyalty.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.879
But that doesn’t count.
It’s a theme, it's a what.

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:22.221
It’s what pervades
throughout the play.

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:23.802
It’s about lying.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.941
Because all the characters
there are lying.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.720
It’s a perfectly valid answer,
what the play’s about.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.103
But it doesn’t help
the writer track his direction

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.514
so that he only has one
way to follow.

00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:49.076
- Therefore, a premise may change

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:53.101
in the middle of the writing,
in the middle of preparing the materials.

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:56.540
- Like say, if your research
runs in contrast,

00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.917
if your facts run
in contrast with your earlier--

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:04.045
whatever’s going through
your head that you wrote

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:11.480
it will change if you see
something else in your research.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.667
- Or in the middle of writing,

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:18.656
you find a different direction
you want to take.

00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:20.232
It's possible.

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.053
It could happen
because your stance could’ve shifted.

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:28.242
If you notice,
that’s your stand

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:34.933
on whatever aspect
of life you want to tackle

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:38.048
That’s when we say
‘into a certain extent’,

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:42.306
that’s why I ask,
what do you really believe in?

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:47.076
For example,
”I believe infidelity is like this…”

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:51.792
- So it’s possible, in the course
of creating the play, to change your mind.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:58.235
You had a life-changing epiphany
about that event in your life.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.567
You suddenly broke up
with a lover.

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:00.782
“Ah that wasn't it,"

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:03.565
"Love is not a joyous thing."

00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:04.502
"It's bullshit!"

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:07.449
You changed,
so your story changes as well.

00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:14.013
But of course
that doesn’t happen all the time.

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:18.673
It can of course,
but it’s part of the writing process.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.520
In the same way,
maybe if you’re making a documentary.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:28.354
Imagine, you have a hypothesis

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:30.575
and then you realize that’s not it.

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:31.754
How about that?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.257
Let’s say, greedy ambition
leads to destruction.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.508
I don’t believe that.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:36.367
Prove it to me.

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:37.299
How?

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:39.167
Tell me what happened.

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:42.852
This, this, this.

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:48.187
So when you keep on
adding details to the story,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.537
there’s nowhere else
to go to but here.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.654
So you proved it
with catharsis, right?

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.282
My only caution,

00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:05.922
if you cling to that too much,

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:08.633
your play might sound didactic.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.514
Especially for beginning writers,

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:15.772
who tend to spell-out everything.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:22.634
“She’s really ambitious.”
“She’s really destructive.”

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:26.320
You’ll hear a character like that, right?

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:29.975
And then she actually dies.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:31.377
Something like that, right?

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:34.907
Because it seems
like the only way.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.737
But that would be less of

00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:44.963
a lack of a shaky premise
as much as it is also a lack of...

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.293
skillful writing.

00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:52.667
Because a very good premise
doesn’t guarantee you

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.697
 a very good play.

00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:57.452
Because there’re plenty of elements.

00:04:57.477 --> 00:04:59.922
There's still an element
of how to do the dialogue.

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.621
How do you give examples
so you can prove this event?

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:07.896
Maybe you’ve done
what others have already done.

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:10.036
It’s just another repetition.

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.184
A cliché, another
stereotyping of a character,

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:18.887
So you try and do something

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:24.843
you think will be
a hit to the audience.

00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:29.908
There are plays
that have many characters

00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:38.650
and they could be a group going through

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:41.631
an obstacle
to reach the conclusion.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.834
It could be a team,

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:48.057
could be a family,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.713
could be...

00:05:52.823 --> 00:05:56.829
a congregation of priests
or a group of friends.

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:00.819
And sometimes their fight
becomes a hurdle

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:03.137
in order to get what they want

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.862
because they’re not united.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:18.484
I think that’s the best way
to make the guide or direction clearer

00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:23.523
in formulating the premise
so you don’t get lost.

00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:26.957
- Do you recommend,

00:06:27.017 --> 00:06:29.190
even if the writer
is still uncertain,

00:06:29.253 --> 00:06:36.697
 that a premise be written
even before writing the play?

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.126
Like what I said,
the danger is

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:46.099
you might get carried away
and the play might become didactic.

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.709
It becomes more than a guide,

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:52.248
which dictates your
every decision.

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:58.014
At this point, you need
to prove this and that.

00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:00.282
The tendency is,

00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:04.770
since your options are narrower,
it becomes a stricture.

00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:08.238
So it doesn't...

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:10.793
as a writer myself,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.282
I started with a clear
premise at the outset

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:29.425
only when I was still new at writing

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:31.944
Because you need an anchor,
you need to say what you want.

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:38.148
When you’re surrounded
by activists, writers with a purpose

00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:40.965
your play needs to
say something clear

00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:43.997
about what’s going on
in our environment.

00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:51.180
So sometimes,
what prevails is the premise

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:57.174
and the play looks like
an essay or a manifesto.

00:07:57.207 --> 00:08:00.323
It has its specific purpose,

00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:06.650
especially at its heydey,
during a time of political ferment.

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:11.831
But it might also be
in the long-run,

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:16.050
a stricture
that you can’t get out of,

00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:21.315
because it becomes
a formula for all your plays.

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:23.994
Sometimes your character

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:29.812
is forced to do things
out of character

00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:34.717
only because your premise prevailed.

00:08:36.296 --> 00:08:44.097
Sometimes your character
may already be screaming, “that’s not me!”

00:08:45.147 --> 00:08:52.942
When you put words
into the mouth of your character,

00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:57.808
It’s not the character
speaking, but you.

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:04.963
That’s what you have to balance.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:15.459
At the same time,
at any point in the writing process,

00:09:15.506 --> 00:09:22.920
maybe it would help
if you already wrote the premise

00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:27.203
because in the end

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:34.384
you’d understand
the play you wrote better.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.512
So you won’t be
like other writers ...

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.060
Aren’t there beginning writers,
when asked,

00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:46.730
“Why’d you write it this way?”

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:48.029
They’d answer,
“Nothing, really.”

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:49.740
- It’s just nice to hear.

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:53.789
- The delivery of the words are nice.

00:09:55.334 --> 00:10:00.725
You might even understand it better
if you formulate it in the end or whatever.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.100
Any questions?

00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:05.679
- So I guess it's like a guide,

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:11.458
let’s say it’s a musical,
to cut out musical numbers that are—

00:10:11.497 --> 00:10:12.350
- Unnecessary.

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:14.086
Yes, something like that.

00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:16.705
The most irrelevant.

00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:22.405
Yes, not just songs,
scenes, and so on.

00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:24.137
Of course, you give some leeway

00:10:24.162 --> 00:10:29.076
because that might be
the most spectacular part.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.243
It might be too bare without it.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:37.013
What makes it complicated
is that you don’t know anything at first

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:40.503
until you go through the last part
and realize, “Oh, it’s like this.”

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:44.594
But you went through a lot
before you realize that.

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:46.750
There are plays like that, right?

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:49.897
It’s cluttered in the beginning
and you don’t know where it’s going.

00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:51.627
“Why’s there a different
character like this?”

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.487
But eventually that’s it.

00:10:54.313 --> 00:11:00.541
There’s actually a connection
to the main premise that you want.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.168
The trajectory’s not always singular,

00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.947
as probably most of the classics are.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:15.408
Relatively, you don't know
where Chekhov's plays are going

00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:19.712
until it all comes together in the end.

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:23.981
All of a sudden irrelevant characters,

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:27.007
you realize,

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:30.610
actually layer

00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:34.193
the main event.

00:11:34.662 --> 00:11:37.752
I guess right now,
I'm thinking

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.430
of when you get
to write your premise

00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:42.424
and it's clear to you
in the beginning,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.407
your objective as writers
is how to occlude it,

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.482
how to cover it,
so it doesn't appear as it is

00:11:50.568 --> 00:11:57.696
in the same way with our
exercise yesterday about beliefs.

00:11:58.974 --> 00:12:00.929
Don't say

00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:04.826
the actual keyword.

00:12:06.689 --> 00:12:09.264
When it's clear to you,
it's clear to you.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:19.066
- It's just a mindset that's there.

00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:24.631
When you're drunk or lost,
you just have to look and it's there.

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:30.763
- So it’s something that really implies,
not explicitly states.

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:32.683
- Yes.
- Until they don't get it anymore.

00:12:32.783 --> 00:12:35.838
- Ah 'yun.
- Aren't some plays like that?

00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:39.310
- You realize "oh, that's what it means."
And it's just there.

00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:42.228
So it's either your fault as audience
or the writer's fault.

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.092
There are cases like that.

00:12:47.117 --> 00:12:52.575
It's pretty clear to the writer
so she buried it deeply for it to be subtle

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.366
to a point where it became
undetectable instead.

00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.650
- That's great, really clever!

00:12:58.574 --> 00:13:01.857
And after that, they'll blame you,
the audience, for not noticing it.

00:13:01.903 --> 00:13:03.377
"You didn't see it?"
"You didn't get it?"

00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:10.438
"Alright, fine, I'm stupid."
That happens, right?

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:16.014
I believe that in the
plays I've written

00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:19.949
there's no one
theme in each play.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:23.467
There could be one
topic, one milieu,

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:26.450
but you could

00:13:26.668 --> 00:13:31.437
generate different themes

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:34.873
like friendship, love, themes of

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:42.213
collaboration, exploitation, and so on.

00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:44.788
You could include everything

00:13:44.843 --> 00:13:46.945
but there's one premise
that'll stand out.

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:49.119
That's the play's direction.

00:13:49.402 --> 00:13:56.219
This is so we could separate
the definition of theme or even message

00:13:57.102 --> 00:14:00.603
because the premise
could be how you see it,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.132
what you follow
underlying the story,

00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:09.737
what guides you
and keeps the story intact.

00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:12.729
Because sometimes
there are plays

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:16.046
where you wonder
who it is you're following,

00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:22.343
what story you should focus on
and where you should anchor yourself.

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:27.081
Usually, when the audience
can't find anything to hold on to

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.318
like the protagonist,

00:14:31.465 --> 00:14:33.349
it's an indication

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:45.048
that you have to liven up the character
you chose to reach the conclusion.

00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:48.062
There are also plays

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:52.165
 that focus on one character
and no one else.

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:59.538
I guess that's what you
need to know about premise.

00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:05.731
The play you're writing,

00:15:05.756 --> 00:15:09.560
I assume you're
already writing the play

00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:13.453
to maximize this course.

00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:23.149
The last assignment I gave
was the character sketch and monologue.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.892
This time

00:15:24.983 --> 00:15:29.096
it might be better for you

00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:34.465
to write the actual story
of your play.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.697
A detailed story.

00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:41.723
What I'm asking for is a storyline.

00:15:43.014 --> 00:15:50.048
This includes your original story

00:15:50.126 --> 00:15:57.500
of the character, or milieu,
or team you chose

00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:59.827
whether it's a group
of friends or a family,

00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:06.340
and what the character is facing
until the conclusion.

00:16:06.729 --> 00:16:10.874
Just describe the story.

00:16:13.617 --> 00:16:16.242
Three pages is already long.

00:16:16.348 --> 00:16:27.869
Usually, you can already tell
or describe the story within two pages.

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:32.468
Let's not think
about the premise yet,

00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:36.622
but if you realize it
after telling the story

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.700
then

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.613
congratulations!

00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:46.914
That doesn't happen often, okay?

00:16:47.148 --> 00:16:49.888
Sometimes there's a eureka moment

00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:54.325
even if you are still
about to find it in the next step.

00:16:54.568 --> 00:16:59.312
But the reason I asked for a storyline

00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:02.292
is for you to have a clearer direction.
