00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:14.477
What are your best practices?
Your favorites?

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:19.263
The best and worst,
even for playwrights, I guess.

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:23.166
Mine is to have coffee
with the director first.

00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:26.657
- Talk about things first
- Even before anything?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.840
After your reading.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:32.436
After the director
reads the script as it is,

00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:35.155
there'll be a lot of questions there.

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:42.366
It's also better if the director’s
also a writer or a storyteller.

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:46.530
She might notice
a lot of gaps in the script.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.307
Loopholes and so on.

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.991
She'll ask you and you'll realize
you made a mistake or something.

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:57.667
At least you can fix it already.

00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:02.060
And you start to get
into a working relationship

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:03.306
with your director.

00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:08.038
- Then you'll see the power--
- Power relations.

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.817
Even if she's a well-acclaimed
or well-renowned director,

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:22.709
she'll still ask and really seek
what you’re trying to say in your script.

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:27.771
- You know that you’re going to trust her.
- She's willing.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:32.670
I think it's also important
to know the director's works.

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:37.074
My experience mostly
came from Virgin Labfest.

00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:40.774
If this is the type of
material you wrote,

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:45.747
you probably had a director in mind
who will direct it.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.984
When JK became
the director for "Symposium"

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.487
and my co-writer and I
wrote a play, “Bago Ilibing”,

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.430
we knew it was for JK to direct.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.828
So you already know
who you can work with

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.130
for that material.

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.455
It's important to know the director

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.946
before you meet
each other.

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:11.918
Or if you're not familiar,
you have to get to know the director.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.350
My Virgin Labfest experience
was with Ed Lacson.

00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.262
We leveled it off.

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.141
I was always curious
about his reading of the script.

00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:27.208
When we're on the same page
or he gives something new, I give it a go.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.860
At the same time,
when working with actors,

00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:33.861
I remember Tita Sherry
when we were rehearsing "Beta".

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.425
She was doing something and
I knew the words were lacking.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.916
She was offering something
that deepened the text

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:41.791
but my words were lacking.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:47.401
So when actors inspire me
to work on my material--

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:50.383
maybe if it's another actor,
there'll be another version.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.246
But when the actor can offer something

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:56.365
that adds to the story,
not necessarily text.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.857
That's a beautiful adjustment.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.323
In terms of PETA, the idea is,

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.305
from day one you're already encouraged
in terms of what ideas to talk about.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.056
From day one,

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:12.990
from pre-draft one,
it's already clear.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.891
Your collaborators also encourage you
to do something that excites you.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.928
That's the difference
when you have a text

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:24.606
or if you're going to get
commissioned.

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:28.405
What excites you,
at the same time, what’s the content.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.773
This is in the top of my head.

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:38.804
I had this experience in a production
where all we did was read.

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:42.753
- Reading? As in reading?
- As in reading.

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:46.781
We're used to “Oh first week reading--”

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:49.262
- Then blocking and so on.

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:52.957
Hala, when you look
at the schedule it's all reading.

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:55.277
Maybe it's stage reading?

00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:04.176
Other actors who were big stars
were getting antsy by the end of the first week

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:08.646
And I'm just, "Oh relax, we're gonna be
reading for a month.”

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:15.520
That was pretty new for me
so I just accepted it.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:20.395
We're reading it in a certain way
and thought this was the right way to read it.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.387
On the second week, I'm already bored.
Bored at my way of reading.

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.193
Oh my god,
"Three Sisters"...?

00:04:27.222 --> 00:04:28.209
No

00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:31.111
No. I don't want to say.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:39.108
I mean, I was bored
with my way of reading.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.930
When I got bored,
I started figuring things out.

00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:47.255
I started remembering
the super basic training

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.221
we had as actors
to pay attention to punctuations.

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:54.631
There’s a reason for the comma,
the period, the ellipsis, and so on.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:57.631
So I looked.
And it was better.

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:03.574
I found a new way of reading it
so I was excited again for the third reading.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:09.032
Come third week,
we were still reading.

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:10.073
I'm serious.

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:11.936
Come third week,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.023
I felt like I didn't know
anything anymore.

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:18.891
Like I was back to zero.

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:22.591
What I thought I knew on the first week
and what I thought I discovered on the second week,

00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.189
I wasn't so sure of anymore
on the third week.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:28.663
But strangely,
when Sir Nonon (director) started blocking us,

00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:31.300
I felt like I knew
exactly what to do.

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:36.203
Something like that because
we already saw so many things while reading.

00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:41.680
After sitting for so long,
we just wanted to act it out.

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:45.430
His flow was similar for "Tempest",
the process was the same.

00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:49.297
You already worked it all out.

00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:52.869
So once you stand up,
everybody’s bodies just moves

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:55.879
because the text becomes part of you.

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:57.164
- Yes, exactly.
- It's another process.

00:05:57.204 --> 00:06:01.262
It’s a wonderful way
to work if we only had that much time.

00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:04.060
Was the playwright there
at the reading the whole time?

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:04.961
No.

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:08.445
But they were
always in discussion.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.233
I think that was
one of the best experiences,

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.415
just working with text.

00:06:14.447 --> 00:06:18.099
We didn’t even discuss anything,
we just read.

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:21.497
We would just read,
and read, and read.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:27.715
Until Lex, Sir Jack, and I
reached this point

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.739
and that's where
we were shaking it off and asking,

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:31.224
"What are we reading?"

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.055
"What did you feel?"

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.729
Even if we weren't told to discuss it,

00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:45.526
we just came together
wanting to do it that way.

00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:51.451
I really liked that process,

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:54.062
but it didn't happen again

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.740
since we're time constrained.

00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:01.299
How about the others?

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.723
Best or worst?

00:07:02.874 --> 00:07:03.996
Just choose one.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.738
Learning points.

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:10.954
- Learning points?

00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:12.144
Yeah.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.335
Mine's probably "Battalia (Royale)".

00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:20.530
At the time,

00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.329
I was new to Manila,
fresh from high school.

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:27.498
A year.

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.133
DUP (Dulaang UP),
I'm from DUP.

00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:33.800
I first worked with--

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:36.733
actually it was my second time
working with JK after "Symposium".

00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:39.474
He invited me to "Battalia".

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:43.889
It was all new to me

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.903
because I had to devise
my own character in the play

00:07:54.363 --> 00:07:59.302
and translate the text
he gave in my own words.

00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:04.297
I just felt alive.
I just felt validated as an actor.

00:08:06.593 --> 00:08:10.843
When you're in DUP,
you're still a student taking directions,

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.259
"Go there, go there, okay.”

00:08:14.284 --> 00:08:15.484
“Oh, face front.”

00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:28.183
I felt validated as an actor,
my voice actually mattered.

00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:33.111
When we played it out,

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:38.006
there was this magical moment
where everyone was in sync.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.852
We weren't supposed
to improvise a scene

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.660
but when we met in the scene,
it was so fun!

00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:52.897
I felt really alive as an actor.

00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.109
That everything I do is valid.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.212
Actually, it’s still
my favorite play until now.
