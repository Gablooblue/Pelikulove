00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:16.924
There are different
kinds of playwrights

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.262
who make their own plays

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:23.573
 due to the urge
of their artistic inspiration.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.642
But there are also
those who are commissioned.

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:29.393
But that doesn’t mean

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.287
if you're commissioned, 
you’re only doing it for the money.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.383
Eventually, part of the process is

00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:37.713
you'll accept the project because

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.018
the idea is great 
and you can do something about it.

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:47.665
I have something to say using this.

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.020
Of course if it’s commissioned,

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:57.427
you have to abide
by the requirements of the company

00:00:57.563 --> 00:00:59.103
or the producer

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.034
or the company.

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:06.586
Those "Juan Tamad" stories,
where did they come from?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.870
Those are always being used
in films and plays

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:16.322
because we’re very familiar
with Juan Tamad’s story.

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.843
Who doesn’t know Juan Tamad, right?

00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:24.408
Yes, he’s a folktale character.
There are a lot of stories about him.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.040
So the tendency, usually,

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.664
is to create another story
using the character type.

00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:36.109
So the character is lazy, but smart.

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:37.476
It’s either he was outwitted

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.289
or he was able to outwit them
because he’s lazy.

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:47.858
In Nick Joaquin's 
"How Love Came to Juan Tamad”,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.480
he mixed different 
Filipino folktale characters.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:54.521
He made Maria Makiling, 
Juan Tamad, and Mt. Banahaw meet

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:00.876
and made a story
like "Midsummer Night’s Dream".

00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:06.663
If you’re going to use
Juan Tamad as a character,

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.882
should it be based on the folklore?

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:12.802
Yes,

00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:19.202
something like that.
Because if you change the name,

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.465
the audience might not get it.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.068
They might think
it’s just an ordinary lazy person.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.892
But if it’s Juan Tamad,

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.200
it carries everything.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.360
It would refer in some way
or another to a guava

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:44.469
or to other episodes of his life,
with a crab and the like.

00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:52.103
- What if there hasn’t been any discussion
in terms of where the adaptation will be based,

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:57.075
like a text or from a
different medium to another,

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:00.908
how do you go about it?

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.169
I know there’s no one way
but in your opinion,

00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:07.138
have you had any experience
where you adapt either

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:11.859
from a classic to a contemporary

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:16.916
or from a film to a play
or from a play to a film?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.223
If I had a say in it,
the first thing I’d ask is,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:27.666
is it possible to adapt
to a Philippine setting,

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:29.962
especially if it’s a classic?

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:34.534
If I get excited
with the idea, then I’d do it.

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:39.193
 But if not, I won’t.

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:44.219
In fact, for me, the hardest
to adapt are American plays

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:47.428
or even to translate.

00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:50.186
Probably because
we also speak English

00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:55.118
and we are very exposed
to American culture on television.

00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:57.853
So much so that you’d ask,

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:06.477
“Why’d you have to adapt it when
we can already understand the context in English?”

00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:13.028
Usually my attitude
when it comes to adapting

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:18.077
is I want to respond to the original.

00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:22.714
It’s like setting up...

00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:26.885
almost like setting up 
some kind of conversation, a discussion

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.268
with the original,

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:32.281
which is what I did
with “D’ Wonder Twins of Boac.”

00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:35.406
Some people said,

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.549
“It’s not Shakespeare anymore,"

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:40.211
"It’s a different play.”

00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:42.078
And my response was,
“Yes, of course.”

00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:44.279
"That's why the title changed."

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:51.894
Because my response was already
included in the play as I read it.

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:58.502
Adaptation is not merely
the mechanical transferring

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:00.361
from this location
to this location

00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:03.392
or translating it
from English to Filipino.

00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:08.933
But it’s more of
what do I think about this?

00:05:09.093 --> 00:05:12.317
Especially if I have
strong feelings for adapting it,

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:16.430
it’s because I also have
something to add to the idea.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.299
And there are times
when people will say,

00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:19.329
"Hey, could you adapt this?”

00:05:19.354 --> 00:05:21.439
And when I read it,
I couldn’t adapt it.

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.036
It’s difficult.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:27.022
Might as well translate it.

00:05:28.013 --> 00:05:30.225
Translate it as is.

00:05:31.038 --> 00:05:33.664
- Will the location be the same?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.592
It’s possible or like what we did
with “The Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing”.

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:42.106
I resisted adapting it

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:45.878
because they wanted
the character to be a Filipina.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:46.766
It's hard.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.405
"Can't we just make the character
vaguely Filipino and not locate it?"

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.532
Because once you locate it,
you’re forced to locate everything.

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:05.161
The sensibilities of the character,
her relationship with other characters,

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.509
it doesn’t fit.

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:10.948
So I think that’s one of the things

00:06:10.973 --> 00:06:15.248
that a writer who wants
to adapt a work

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.067
will have to take into consideration.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.473
Does it blend, sit well?

00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:25.664
Does it resonate
to the sensibility of the target...

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.624
milieu?

00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:33.348
- In terms of influence as a writer,

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:36.982
let’s say you already see
how the production will run.

00:06:38.343 --> 00:06:43.350
Do we have a say
if this is not how I visualized it

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:46.593
in so far as 
how I prepared the script?

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:53.213
What are the boundaries
separating us as writers

00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:55.940
from the director
and everyone else in the production?

00:06:56.112 --> 00:06:57.386
It really depends.

00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:00.910
There is no...

00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:03.074
artistic rule

00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.082
as much as there are more

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.979
political reasons for it.

00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:11.133
It depends on your power.

00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:15.710
It depends.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:21.594
If you’re a budding playwright who’s
wide-eyed and enthusiastic,

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:23.172
"I want to see the different
sides of theater",

00:07:23.197 --> 00:07:27.687
and then the veteran 
Tony Mabesa will be the director,

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:29.945
can you say that to him?

00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:37.680
Won’t it be reversed?

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:41.613
If the director comes up to you
and criticizes you,

00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:46.393
the only thing you’d be
able to say is “Yes, I see.”

00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:50.979
So some other factors come into play
in the production process.

00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:53.039
Not necessarily aesthetic.

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:57.977
This could happen
if the main artistic differences

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:02.695
and status of the playwright
and director are almost the same.

00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.504
But it goes through negotiation, right?

00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:09.971
That happens many times
in the Virgin Labfest processes.

00:08:11.963 --> 00:08:17.057
Status negotiations
are at play in the process.

00:08:17.283 --> 00:08:18.641
Not only in the artistic sense,

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:21.285
but also probably
because the playwright

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.595
should also be ready
to defend his work

00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:30.784
because it’s assumed
that more than anyone else,

00:08:30.828 --> 00:08:34.171
at that particular point
of the rehearsal,

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:39.312
it is the writer who knows more
about his work than anyone.

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:40.211
Not even the director.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:42.685
Eventually, when the director is done
with the production, more or less,

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.841
they’ll have the same grasp

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:50.819
of how the production will go.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.190
I think, maybe at one
point of the rehearsal

00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:58.682
the playwright just had so
many other things to do.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.784
When the playwright returns, 
the play's different.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:05.334
There are playwrights who’d say,
“Surprise me”.

00:09:06.354 --> 00:09:08.907
And they do get surprised.

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:12.056
We never say,
“Pleasantly surprise me.”

00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:14.640
Or dismayed.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.143
That can happen.

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:22.020
But while you have--

00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:26.339
Eventually, as different from cinema

00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:31.647
where the scriptwriter
has a lot less control over the material

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.988
once it is being shot,

00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:41.162
the playwright has full control
even after the production.

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:41.754
Why?

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:47.799
Because it can be restaged
by another director.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.183
Right?

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:56.429
That’s why you have more control
and ownership when you’re a playwright.

00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:59.549
The most recent one I did was,
of course, “Ibalong,”

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.623
which you could
hardly call an epic

00:10:02.683 --> 00:10:04.722
but still,

00:10:05.886 --> 00:10:07.175
it was based from

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.160
a legend about the pride of Bicol.

00:10:13.268 --> 00:10:16.333
Not just Naga, but Bicol.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.277
There are a lot of sources
you can get from.

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:29.849
I think one of the more unique sources,

00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:33.210
because we’re Filipinos, are our...

00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:38.862
traditions and cultural practices
-- although they're fading.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:45.064
Of course, you’ll face issues
like cultural appropriation.

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:48.538
But you have to weigh
what really matters here.

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:55.950
The community itself
has already forgotten the tradition

00:10:58.738 --> 00:10:59.642
as against

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:06.123
you misrepresenting
the community's tradition.

00:11:06.397 --> 00:11:08.946
These kinds of issues
will definitely come up.

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:12.067
If you still want to continue,

00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:14.284
your assignment is...

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:18.581
to pitch to me three

00:11:20.852 --> 00:11:21.785
genres

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:26.200
or three plays
that may have different genres

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.267
or three stories

00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:31.369
that may have different lengths.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.873
One-act or full-length.

00:11:34.116 --> 00:11:35.327
Two-acts.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.190
Or choose a form of a play.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.594
It could be allegorical,
using symbols and the like.

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:49.503
It could be realistic or traditional.

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.019
Or simply comedy or tragedy.

00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:02.614
Just write a short description of the story

00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:07.624
and then let's discuss it
on the forum thread.
