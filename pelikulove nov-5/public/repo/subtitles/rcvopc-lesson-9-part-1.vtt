00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.721
I’d like to share with you

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:17.555
one of my first written plays

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.724
so that I can tell you
how my writing process was

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:23.082
until I reached

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:25.517
the first draft or final draft.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.464
I think this play
is somehow personal for me

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:35.100
because...

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:41.034
it discusses identity
and how I realized

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.948
it wasn’t only me.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.060
There was a time, of course,

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:52.457
I think it’s probably
common for gay people,

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:55.180
that they don’t
immediately “come out”

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.611
because it depends on their family,

00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:04.761
on how open or supportive
a family is with their children’s identity.

00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:09.614
And I happened to belong
to a not-so-supportive side at that time.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.686
I’ve forgiven
my parents, by the way.

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:14.546
And I love my mother.

00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:22.363
It’s kind of like...

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:24.496
one of the plays

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.979
which I really based
from personal experience.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.522
Partly, from my personal experience,

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:37.426
there’s just one scene that I used

00:01:37.783 --> 00:01:41.614
but it’s more of a
collective experience

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.559
of a group that I joined

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:48.020
when I was starting to discover

00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:51.357
being open as a gay person.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.543
I joined a small group at PETA

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.545
and other friends from PETA joined

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.981
and we shared our experiences
about coming out and living as gay people,

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:14.133
some partly open,
some partly closeted.

00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:21.197
The group got bigger
and that’s where I based my materials.

00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:24.749
The truth is I wasn’t
supposed to write it.

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:26.501
PETA commissioned it,

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:29.759
and they commissioned
one person from the group.

00:02:29.806 --> 00:02:33.055
But that person wasn’t able to do it
so it fell on my lap.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:37.259
And I started interviewing

00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:39.358
former seminarists,

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:49.517
people who worked
in the business sector.

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:53.396
Especially at that time,

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.952
gay people weren’t that open

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.083
and back then
it could affect careers.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.039
It could greatly affect
a corporate person

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:07.319
who was climbing up the ladder.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:16.264
Those are the collective experiences
that I’ve included in the play.

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:27.607
I found the connecting link or the hook

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.108
because

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.025
first of all

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.889
I liked Diana Ross.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.858
I don’t know
if you’re familiar with Diana Ross,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.210
you can google that.

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:39.483
I know there are kids these days

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:43.887
who don’t recognize her
and her songs anymore.

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:46.325
But at that time,

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:49.916
Diana Ross was such
a huge gay icon.

00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:56.382
There were three actually:
Diana Ross, Barbara Streisand, and Liza Minnelli.

00:03:56.457 --> 00:03:59.844
You go to any gay bar then

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.026
and they were the ones being
impersonated by performers.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.063
You can't perform one
without the other.

00:04:05.303 --> 00:04:08.900
So Diana Ross was a perfect...

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:16.248
conceit for the whole play.

00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:22.813
And when I “found” her,

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:27.547
I was able to write the play quickly.

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:29.220
The story developed faster

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.123
when I "found"
the connecting link.

00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:39.281
I included Diana in the story

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:47.195
as the alter ego
of the main character,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.081
who happens to be Andy,
which is an anagram somehow.

00:04:51.253 --> 00:04:55.995
I mean phonetically of Diana.
Diana, Andy.

00:04:56.394 --> 00:05:00.051
So that’s the name
of the main character.

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:04.053
I focused on five scenes
about his life.

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:08.651
From his childhood
to his becoming a seminarist,

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:12.712
to becoming engaged
and then married,

00:05:12.768 --> 00:05:15.145
but in love with a man.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.685
Until he committed suicide,

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:21.670
and finally, at the hospital.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:25.525
So those five stories,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.235
those five scenes,

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:32.043
not acts, just scenes

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:37.551
told the story of coming out
and the pain of coming out

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:49.190
as a gay person living
in a limiting environment.

00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:58.889
I initially chose the songs
that Diana Ross would sing

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.859
in order to enhance the story

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:07.348
or for the opening
and closing of a scene.

00:06:07.397 --> 00:06:13.740
I also used the songs
as commentary on the obstacles

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:17.010
that the main character faces.

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:21.901
I was a big fan of Diana Ross,
but during rehearsals,

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:25.977
It turned out, the director Soxie Topacio
was an even bigger fan than I was

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:28.524
and he had a complete
collection of Diana Ross.

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:35.408
He was able to screen the songs
that were more appropriate for the play.

00:06:36.676 --> 00:06:40.619
Basically, that’s what
 the play went through.

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.387
It’s not only the story
of one person.

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:46.596
The story of exorcism,
that’s my story.

00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:55.128
Other scenes came from
the different people that I interviewed

00:06:55.197 --> 00:07:02.394
so I guess the play was formed
through the interviews.

00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:06.884
What I’m trying
to say here is that

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:09.800
even if I had relevant experiences

00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:15.331
it’s still important for me
to hear other gay people’s voices,

00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:20.398
in order to enrich,
deepen, and layer

00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:24.932
the experiences that the
character went through,

00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:31.135
and to reach out
to more audiences,

00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:33.624
At the same time,

00:07:34.024 --> 00:07:38.349
I anchored on an environment

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:42.494
that’s common knowledge

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.819
to ordinary people,
whether gay or straight.

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:54.795
Diana Ross’ songs
helped me form the structure.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:03.248
So read the play and
give your comments

00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:04.335
if it’s okay.

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:08.883
The title is “How I Killed Diana Ross”.
