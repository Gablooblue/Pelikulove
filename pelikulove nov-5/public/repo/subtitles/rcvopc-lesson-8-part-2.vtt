00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.399
There are some people who believe

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:19.621
that the definition
of story and plot are different.

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:27.581
Martin Scorsese defines
story and plot differently.

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:30.889
The story for him
is the story itself.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.100
The king married
the queen and had a child.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:43.942
The child grew up
and saw the spinning wheel.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.402
She pricked herself
and then fell asleep.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:49.208
That’s the story.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:51.847
While the plot

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.137
includes the motivation
of all the characters,

00:00:58.385 --> 00:00:59.507
wherein

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:04.399
the spinning wheel is cursed,

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:09.741
and how the king hid

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.736
the spinning wheel
from his innocent child.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.267
That’s part of the plot

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:18.642
because that's the reason

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.046
behind the character’s actions.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:28.577
So while the story is flowing,
the plot is also moving forward.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:33.991
That’s a different definition,

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:38.782
but valid all the same.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.776
For me, it’s important

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.731
that you can separate it,

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:47.619
balance it out

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:52.821
especially if it’s purely plot—
thoughts, motivations of the character.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.985
It’s got something to do
with what I said in the previous sessions.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:01.026
The plot deepens
when the character ponders.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:04.862
And if the character
is actually doing something.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.468
- Isn’t there something
like the first act ends

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:16.331
when the character
resolves the conflict

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.472
and then the second act is--

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:20.143
You introduce another?

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.492
or has the effect of resolving gradually?

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:31.432
If it’s conventional, yes.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.052
But it's not necessary
to resolve it.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.080
It might cause more tension.

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:43.048
The implication
from the decision

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.788
might create bigger
or heavier problems.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.581
For example,
in the first act.

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:53.834
Let’s say Macbeth kills the king.

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:56.876
In the next act
Macbeth becomes king.

00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:58.990
This causes more complications

00:02:59.061 --> 00:03:04.866
because he wants to reign
the kingdom until he has a child.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.206
After that, he kills those

00:03:08.312 --> 00:03:11.433
he perceives as threats

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:13.588
until he ends up
killing so many people.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:18.527
That's already set
and things just worsen.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.378
'Til there's nowhere
to go in the end.

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:26.787
It could be something like that,
that’s the most conventional.

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:29.953
We also have something called--

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:35.478
Especially in cinema, we also have
the three-act structure of screenwriting.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:37.914
When the first act is done,

00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:40.914
the problem
should have been introduced.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.224
Somewhere in the second act,
you create false hope.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.655
The problem seems solved,
when it actually isn't

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.143
and underneath it
is a bigger problem

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.427
which will be towards
the end of the second act

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:59.451
where you think
the character is losing.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.988
And then the third act comes,
where she has a realization,

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.978
which is the real victory.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.493
Or Rocky could lose,
but he’s still a winner inside.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.513
Something like that.

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:16.368
Although that’s conventional,
this play could be something different.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.682
I’m not sure

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.531
when the division of acts began.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.152
Its definition is--

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.678
But the set definition of this is,

00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:43.793
like what I said,
it creates a dramatic curve.

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:53.302
If something wasn’t resolved
and caused a huge incident instead,

00:04:56.197 --> 00:05:03.840
it could be made into several scenes.

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:11.374
And then the next act

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:14.469
could start again with,

00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:16.518
let's say we're at the rising action,

00:05:16.574 --> 00:05:17.981
the king died,

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:21.464
what will happen
after the king dies?

00:05:21.727 --> 00:05:24.842
The one who knows

00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:29.053
Macbeth’s secret is killed.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.805
Afterwards,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.127
he ordered to kill
the threats to his throne

00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:40.530
just so he could remain as king.

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:47.626
He did not only kill the king,
but wanted to kill the king’s children as well.

00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:49.102
Something like that.

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:51.724
The problem gets
bigger and bigger.

00:05:51.826 --> 00:05:56.279
That's what sets
when the act ends.

00:05:57.318 --> 00:06:03.544
In fact, I think Shakespeare’s plays
are not written in acts

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.988
a lot of that was done
by scholars, directors.

00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.554
They collectively agreed
that this scene will end in that act.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.922
Because if you look
at Macbeth’s script,

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:15.641
if you remove the act breaks,

00:06:15.737 --> 00:06:18.192
It’s continuous,
just one scene after another.

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:19.621
There're a lot of scenes.

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:22.853
Sometimes, it’s too short
that it doesn't even fill a page.

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:25.961
"When shall we meet again?"

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.537
"In thunder, lighting, or in rain?"

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.367
"Macbeth!"

00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:31.527
"Go, go, to."

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:32.880
It's done.

00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:33.883
The next act follows.

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:35.588
It's Macbeth's turn.

00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:38.355
Sometimes it’s too long.

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.831
It's similar to Brecht's scenes.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.744
He didn't use act breaks.

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:47.010
The concept of acts
became more important.

00:06:47.138 --> 00:06:51.774
Especially during
the Enligtenment period,

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.070
when the concept of unity of time,
 space, and action was introduced.

00:06:57.837 --> 00:06:59.604
Watching an act

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:04.893
is like catching
the characters in a scene

00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:08.564
at a particular time until it ends.

00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:13.569
There’s an illusion of real time.

00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:19.219
It’s what we call
the fourth wall, right?

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.808
As if the audience
is peeking at the door

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.757
just when someone
who’s about to get married comes in.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.187
they watch 'til the end
'til the characters split up.

00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:33.296
But only until that scene.

00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:36.585
If you add a new complication,

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:40.032
a second act will appear.

00:07:40.138 --> 00:07:43.713
If you add another one,
a third act or up to five acts—

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.940
Five acts is the most number
of acts as far as I know.

00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:50.968
Chekhov is the master of that.

00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:55.252
One scene,

00:07:55.337 --> 00:07:56.735
one event,

00:07:56.798 --> 00:07:58.257
one act.

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:03.616
And then what comes
after the scene is an act again.

00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:09.530
Now, there's a...

00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:13.107
you need some
discipline in doing this

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:14.963
because you have to select

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:20.440
the dramatic elements
you can include and integrate,

00:08:20.503 --> 00:08:23.846
while still moving
the story forward.

00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:33.135
There’s a little bit
of realism there.

00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:38.618
I think it’s the same with Ibsen.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.676
He divides his acts,
especially the ones with realism.

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:46.862
Compared to, for example,
his earlier play “Peer Gynt’”

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.942
There were so many scenes

00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:53.741
and the character
went to so many places.

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:57.227
There were so many scenes

00:08:57.276 --> 00:09:00.330
It was confusing
and there were so many characters.

00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:09.124
Does Neil Simon
have something like that?

00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:10.892
Like per act?

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.110
- Per time, place.

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:16.724
It requires a particular discipline

00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:18.125
to write in that way.

00:09:18.188 --> 00:09:20.164
It's not that easy.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:22.065
First,

00:09:22.152 --> 00:09:23.859
before you start,

00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:26.651
you have to create
and choose a point of attack.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:30.438
When's the best part
to start a story?

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.980
You’re already at the high point

00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:36.236
and then there’s a lady
screaming in the background.

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:40.617
So that when it starts,
you introduce the conflict right away.

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.798
Let’s say you start

00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:48.653
with a maid opening the curtain.

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:51.837
That’s a pretty corny device.

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:54.750
The maid is opening the curtain
until another maid comes,

00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:57.300
“Hey! Do you know
what happened last night?"

00:09:57.447 --> 00:09:59.984
"Yeah. The guy did this
and this and this.”

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:04.315
Minor characters
introducing the main character

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:06.892
and then the
main character appears.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.429
Well, at least,

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:11.243
he will be saved from explaining

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:12.463
the conflict.

00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:14.880
The gossipers are there

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:17.935
to explain what’s happening
to the audience.

00:10:18.446 --> 00:10:23.919
Those are some realistic devices

00:10:24.003 --> 00:10:26.670
that any writer can use.

00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:29.965
Of course, since it’s been used often,

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:33.007
it’s become cliché.

00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:39.814
In a musical,
it begins with a song.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:44.640
♫♪ Good morning to this town,
this beautiful, beautiful town ♪♫

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:46.863
Isn’t that like
Beauty and the Beast?

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:55.686
There are times
when it already becomes a standard.

00:10:55.741 --> 00:11:00.779
and the second song
for any musical will have to be...

00:11:00.842 --> 00:11:02.310
the wish,

00:11:02.404 --> 00:11:04.876
the dream of the character.

00:11:05.504 --> 00:11:07.589
For Little Mermaid,

00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:09.052
it’s “Part of That World.”

00:11:09.114 --> 00:11:12.391
Beauty and the Beast is the same.

00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:16.931
So that’s how
they do certain standards.

00:11:16.964 --> 00:11:21.407
But the writer can also break
the standards at his own risk.

00:11:24.522 --> 00:11:29.326
So that’s how...

00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:32.938
we divide scenes.

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:38.425
You don’t have

00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:41.154
to resort to doing

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:44.075
a play divided by acts.

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:51.854
There are a huge number of playwrights
who do not follow the act division.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.605
In the theater industry,

00:11:55.707 --> 00:11:58.532
the reason why
it’s called an act is because

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.836
the director decides
when the intermission takes place.

00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:04.896
The director dictates,
“Okay, we’ll have the intermission here”

00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:08.186
So the the first act
can be before the intermission.

00:12:08.243 --> 00:12:10.338
The second act
is after the intermission

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:13.705
in the eyes of the audience
and the production crew.

00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:17.030
Notice that when you purchase a script,

00:12:17.093 --> 00:12:19.983
the act division is different

00:12:20.008 --> 00:12:23.980
or there isn’t an act division at all,
but just a division of scenes.

00:12:25.317 --> 00:12:28.204
Or there’s just one scene

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:31.262
and then the character
just keeps on narrating

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:33.825
while the setting changes
from time to time.

00:12:35.436 --> 00:12:38.337
For example,
I could think of

00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:42.999
Mark Haddon’s
“The Curious Incident of the Dog...”

00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:44.709
What's it again?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:48.332
Curious incident
of a dog killed somewhere.

00:12:48.378 --> 00:12:49.378
That.

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:52.673
When you read the play,

00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:59.517
the division of scenes
isn't that demarcated.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.428
because I think
it was improvised.

00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:06.685
While the character travelled to London,

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:13.085
there are choruses that enumerate
the different products or things he sees,

00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:16.724
Ttrying to get into the consciousness

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:20.187
of the character who is autistic

00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:23.238
or seemingly special.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.677
There're a lot of devices
that can be used in theater.

00:13:31.747 --> 00:13:35.592
I think that’s theater’s advantage.

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:37.227
Even over cinema

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:39.195
which at this point

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:41.144
is heavily biased

00:13:41.222 --> 00:13:43.222
on realism.

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:50.495
That’s why when you translate
a lot of theatrical devices into cinema,

00:13:50.623 --> 00:13:52.897
it either throws you off
or it doesn’t work.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.177
When we go
inside the moviehouse,

00:13:56.313 --> 00:13:59.447
somehow we have some
assumptions and expectations

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:03.271
that the logic in cinema
will have to be realistic.

00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:06.251
Whether it’s a Marvel superhero

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.438
or a Star Wars character,

00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:09.814
it has to be logical.

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.572
I don’t know why it’s like that.

00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:17.643
Meanwhile, cinema
started out from fantasy, right?

00:14:20.524 --> 00:14:22.659
“The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari”

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:24.034
It's so different.

00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:26.904
In fact, that was very expressionistic.

00:14:27.632 --> 00:14:31.840
In theater, there are so many
devices that you can use,

00:14:31.902 --> 00:14:36.081
melding realism
and fantasy together.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.207
Why do people
suddenly burst into song?

00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:41.039
That’s why it’s so surprising

00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:44.216
if you’re not used
to watching it on film.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.589
“Why are they singing?"

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.900
"What is that?”

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:51.932
It takes a while to get used to it, right?
Something like that.

00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:59.234
But in theater, when the character sings,
you think, “That’s natural!”

00:14:59.382 --> 00:15:02.818
You’re not bothered or anything.

00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:08.413
And you’re aware of the artifice,

00:15:10.591 --> 00:15:13.804
But when you place
the artifice in cinema,

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:17.351
it takes a while
for you to get used to it.

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:22.676
- Is it the same with Filipino plays

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.260
or works written by Filipinos?

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:30.117
What is?

00:15:30.487 --> 00:15:31.291
- Common?

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.562
- What’s common?

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:40.132
No! The history of Philippine
contemporary theater is really varied.

00:15:40.604 --> 00:15:42.549
It's really varied.

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:46.052
There are...

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:52.322
I guess in Virgin Labfest
the tendency is what’s feasible for a one act.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:53.827
Something like that.

00:15:54.782 --> 00:15:59.802
But in the history of Philippine
contemporary theater,

00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:01.208
it’s varied.

00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:05.359
Especially in traditional theater.
It’s really not divided into acts.

00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:06.762
Sometimes

00:16:07.894 --> 00:16:10.811
the duration of a play
can last for a whole day.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.098
Senakulo is what?
One week.

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:18.060
You start with Genesis
and end with Assumption

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:21.081
or even reach
the Final Judgement

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:23.333
 if you're enthusiastic.

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:27.863
In traditional theatre
is so much more complex--

00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:31.667
they would even add
things not from the bible.

00:16:33.978 --> 00:16:40.597
Contemporary theater
utilizes a lot of other sources.

00:16:42.508 --> 00:16:44.703
It's not that–

00:16:44.797 --> 00:16:50.480
Realism of course
has its own timeline.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.988
A semblance of realism
happened when the sarsuwela came in.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:02.283
And to think that sarsuwela
is still song and...

00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:05.992
In sarswela,
that’s when they started,

00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:09.755
talking about people,
and not about Romans, Jews,

00:17:09.803 --> 00:17:14.925
Jesus Christ or the Albanians
and the middle ages.

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:19.234
It’s about the ordinary Filipino
who do cockfights and such, right?

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:23.948
That’s how it started, I guess,

00:17:24.854 --> 00:17:27.145
when Filipinos could reflect

00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:30.262
“Ah, I can relate to that
with regards to my ordinary life.”

00:17:30.308 --> 00:17:31.642
Something like that.

00:17:32.373 --> 00:17:35.753
I want you to create a scenario.

00:17:35.898 --> 00:17:37.074
What’s a scenario?

00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:41.317
It's the actual play itself
that you're seeing.

00:17:41.342 --> 00:17:43.116
It's not just the story.

00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:49.349
but the play that you visualize
being mounted on stage.

00:17:49.644 --> 00:17:53.360
You’re now describing the scenes

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.196
of your play.

00:17:55.243 --> 00:17:57.653
If it’s a one-scene play,

00:17:57.722 --> 00:17:59.902
you’re describing...

00:17:59.956 --> 00:18:02.559
what is happening
from the beginning of the scene

00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:05.176
until the end of it.

00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:09.460
If it’s one-act,
then that’s it.

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:10.826
Whatever the flow,

00:18:10.851 --> 00:18:12.828
when a mother enters

00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:17.452
and sees her child staring

00:18:17.499 --> 00:18:21.238
at a plate full of bacon and eggs,

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:24.428
the mother would ask the child,
the child doesn’t answer.

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:28.929
The mother panics.

00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:32.352
“What’s happening?
Is she sick again?”

00:18:35.258 --> 00:18:37.934
“Did she take the medicine?”

00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:39.413
You can describe that

00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:42.974
not necessarily in dialogue form

00:18:43.071 --> 00:18:46.583
You’re describing the scene

00:18:47.452 --> 00:18:49.073
so that it will be clearer to you

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:53.317
when you’ll have to include
various information on the story

00:18:53.395 --> 00:18:55.598
along the way.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:02.895
What will trigger the introduction
of complications in the story?

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:05.207
Scene one, what is happening?

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:11.839
It’s like you’re describing
what you’re seeing on stage

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:17.512
when the play you’re writing is shown.

00:19:18.247 --> 00:19:20.145
From the beginning to the end.

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.645
It’s not the chronology of the story,

00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:25.609
it’s the chronology of the play.

00:19:25.723 --> 00:19:27.663
What happens next?

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:31.481
What do you want
the audience to see

00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:33.061
at what point?

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:37.877
This is where the control comes

00:19:39.717 --> 00:19:42.309
in in terms of revealing
parts of the story.

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:49.957
Especially if you’re interested
in creating reveals or the punch or the twist.

00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:54.427
If you don’t develop
the twist right,

00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:56.489
then it sucks.

00:19:57.082 --> 00:19:59.795
This is because
you didn’t lay it out right.

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:03.388
The scenario can help you do that.

00:20:03.978 --> 00:20:05.909
And you can revise the scenario

00:20:05.949 --> 00:20:07.523
in the course of writing it

00:20:07.586 --> 00:20:08.903
before

00:20:09.723 --> 00:20:11.692
you embark on writing

00:20:12.716 --> 00:20:14.098
the draft.

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:19.139
This is also what
tells you or what validates

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.250
the quality of your character.

00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:25.425
Even without the dialogue

00:20:25.455 --> 00:20:28.824
we realize what kind
of character you have

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:30.917
because of what she does.

00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:36.356
That’s also another
important reason in making scenarios

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:42.270
because sometimes
you become forced

00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:47.301
to create situations
where your character can show

00:20:47.364 --> 00:20:50.904
her personality without verbalizing it.

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:54.491
I want you to make a scenario.

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.145
It’s just simple.

00:20:57.223 --> 00:21:00.477
You just have to describe
the first scene,

00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:04.293
where it took place,
the characters in that scene,

00:21:04.403 --> 00:21:06.003
and what they are doing.

00:21:06.106 --> 00:21:07.389
Just a short description.

00:21:07.414 --> 00:21:10.442
After that is the next scene.

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:13.707
If this is a musical,
will there be a song?

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:16.551
By this time,
if you're done with the storyline

00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:18.646
you've already chosen

00:21:18.725 --> 00:21:22.358
a genre and style.

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:29.900
If it’s a musical,
in the scenario,

00:21:29.962 --> 00:21:34.685
you've already plotted
when the characters perform.

00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:37.617
When do the big
production numbers happen?

00:21:38.477 --> 00:21:41.173
Will they be dancing
on the beach?

00:21:45.407 --> 00:21:47.729
You’ve already planned

00:21:49.489 --> 00:21:52.938
if they’ll be talking or not.

00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:56.268
But, you’re describing

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.549
a scene that people
are already watching.

00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:07.799
Again, you're becoming
more aware, as a writer.

00:22:07.957 --> 00:22:11.837
That what you’re writing
should be performable,

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.162
perceptively performable.

00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:24.033
She's not just sitting
and thinking about a lot of things.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.887
No, you should bring it out.

00:22:25.912 --> 00:22:27.351
But if she's thinking,

00:22:27.374 --> 00:22:31.834
other characters could
dramatize what she's thinking.

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:33.860
That can be your writing style.

00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:37.691
of your chosen story.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.955
Nevertheless, this is the scenario.

00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:46.819
Like what I said
on the previous sessions,

00:22:46.882 --> 00:22:48.445
you get to decide

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.601
whether to make this a one-act

00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:51.431
because your ideas are limited

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.477
or you can have a number of scenes.

00:22:54.502 --> 00:22:58.388
Or you could divide those into acts.

00:22:58.771 --> 00:23:05.664
Each act is usually comprised
of a huge event

00:23:06.212 --> 00:23:10.454
that will pave the way
for a bigger complication

00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:14.485
to create another act.

00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:19.954
Usually, a conventional piece
reaches up to 5 acts.

00:23:20.071 --> 00:23:22.296
For example, Shakespeare usually has five acts.

00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:25.511
Sometimes, Chekhov has four acts.

00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:29.990
So, in creating a scenario,

00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:32.527
you should consider the length.

00:23:33.295 --> 00:23:35.206
You should be
thinking about it now.

00:23:35.737 --> 00:23:39.547
And this is your way
of organizing things.

00:23:40.102 --> 00:23:43.743
How will you insert the information

00:23:44.683 --> 00:23:49.937
that the friend of your enemy
is actually your child?

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.092
When will you put the information

00:23:55.048 --> 00:24:00.138
that someone lied to their partners?

00:24:00.447 --> 00:24:02.364
When will you insert this part?

00:24:02.427 --> 00:24:04.732
This is where you organize it

00:24:04.802 --> 00:24:06.536
because this is where you will see
the scenes,

00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:08.793
especially if your play is long.

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:10.459
I do it too.

00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.937
I create a scenario if the play is long.

00:24:12.962 --> 00:24:13.829
If it's a one-act play,

00:24:13.854 --> 00:24:16.392
it depends on the duration.

00:24:16.444 --> 00:24:19.900
But if the play
reaches full length,

00:24:21.361 --> 00:24:23.401
outlining is another way

00:24:23.478 --> 00:24:27.684
of writing a scenario.

00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:32.338
It’s possible that I don't remember
things that I already wrote

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:35.418
so I might end up
writing them back again.

00:24:35.572 --> 00:24:40.548
It’s better to write it so
you can see what's going on.

00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:44.704
But, there are also
a number of applications,

00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:46.845
if you’re familiar with computers,

00:24:46.907 --> 00:24:50.614
where you’re allowed
to drag the scenes freely,

00:24:52.306 --> 00:24:54.425
and just point-and-click

00:24:54.455 --> 00:24:57.582
if you want to revise things.

00:24:57.649 --> 00:25:01.510
That is included in creating
the structure of the play.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.026
That is what you have to do.

00:25:04.074 --> 00:25:05.643
Write a scenario.

00:25:05.692 --> 00:25:10.252
Usually, a scenario would
probably be about 5 to 6 pages,

00:25:10.304 --> 00:25:13.305
4 to 5, 4 to 6 pages,

00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:16.340
because it is just a description.

00:25:16.574 --> 00:25:21.214
You're only narrating.
Character A talked to Character B.

00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:23.900
And they talked about this.

00:25:23.947 --> 00:25:26.151
So, this has no dialogue yet.

00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:28.173
This is one step before

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:33.682
you actually venture in
writing the first draft.

00:25:34.729 --> 00:25:36.002
Good luck!
