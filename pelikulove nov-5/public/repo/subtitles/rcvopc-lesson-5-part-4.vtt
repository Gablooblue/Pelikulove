00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:19.132
Another category to consider
is the length of the play you’re writing.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.586
Whether it’s a one-act,
short play, full-length, or five acts

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.773
Five acts is the longest
I think there is,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.358
or cycles of plays
that’s really long.

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:36.842
It all depends

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.837
on the broadness and scope 
of the idea you want to develop.

00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:44.892
The one-act play,
in its strictest form,

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:48.945
was developed during
the enlightenment period in Europe

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.562
wherein time, space,
and action were unified.

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:58.551
This means the moment
the play starts

00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:03.344
it’s like we caught the characters

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.681
in the act of doing
something ‘til the end.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.338
The illusion of this
is that it all happened

00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:12.543
under 45 minutes or within an hour.

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.737
And we caught
the action red-handedly.

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:20.732
There’s no change in time,
no change in setting.

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:21.644
That’s it.

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.325
That’s what we call
a one-act play.

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:32.981
Chekhov’s five-act plays
or three-act plays are like that.

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:37.231
The scenes don’t change
in the first act.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.677
When it changes,

00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:45.466
the next act comes up
and it’s also one scene.

00:01:49.024 --> 00:01:52.953
It would’ve been
very conducive

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:56.261
if the play was realistic.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.989
Now, if the length

00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:59.996
is either one-act or full length,

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:03.497
it will depend on how

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:08.572
you want to tell the story.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:11.317
There are stories
that are really long

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:14.417
and there are some
that are really short.

00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:18.415
But aside from that,
it will still depend

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.072
on what you want to say.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:28.623
It will really just depend
on how broad and long your story is.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.139
When the story is long,
the things you want to say increases.

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.068
For example,

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:45.918
it could start in the establishment
of an organization or company

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.586
and then the obstacles it faced.

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:52.676
So it might have collapsed,
re-established, and so on.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:03:00.091
It's like one turn of events
creates another problem,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.378
so the problem intensifies

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:10.085
until you're able to prove the strength
and skill of the characters

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.177
in order to triumph over
whatever it is they're fighting for.

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:20.402
But if you can do it
in the blink of an eye,

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:21.685
that's a one-act play

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.756
because that's only 
what you have to say.

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:29.497
 There are also cycles of plays.

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:34.713
It's called a play cycle,
meaning five plays in one.

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:41.730
The experience is not complete
if you don't get to see all five plays.

00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:46.964
Like a novel in four parts
or a saga, the Rosales saga

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:54.649
are five completely different novels
but you know, taken as one.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:58.461
You'll see the whole
landscape of Rosales, Pangasinan.

00:03:58.913 --> 00:03:59.953
Something like that.

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:05.390
So plays can go on
and on and on.

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:11.375
Depending on how all the ideas
still relate and connect to each other in the end

00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:17.528
but they can also be
one spurt of idea and still be impactful.

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.854
So I’m not giving any...

00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:25.900
I don't have a preference

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:28.062
on whether you should do
one-act or full-length.

00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:29.408
It depends.

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:33.761
The important thing is the idea.

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:37.495
Most of the one-act ideas,

00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:40.783
most of them are simple.

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:46.271
As if it doesn’t really merit
or deserve being written as a play.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.950
Maybe it’s better
written as an article.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:55.392
Or as a personal essay,
or a shoutout on Twitter.

00:04:55.493 --> 00:04:59.126
Something like that,
a status or something.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:06.345
Rather than a play that needs
actors, directors, stage, sets.

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:11.562
If that’s all you have to show,
I already saw the viral video of Jollibee.

00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:17.927
That’s more expensive
because it went viral.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.603
Still, the point is

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.622
what do you want to say?

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:28.001
But of course,

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:34.151
 as writers, I encourage you
to write full-length plays,

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:39.949
but I’m not saying that all
full-length plays are deeper than one-acts.

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:41.191
Not necessarily.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.666
They can go on and on and on
and still be fluff.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.565
But I think it’s a good exercise for you

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.704
to develop your ideas
on a grander scale.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.542
- Can you start with one-act,
then when it’s done you can expand it,

00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.390
using that one-act as a full-length?

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:12.690
That’s possible.
But that’s no guarantee.

00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:18.611
That’s what happened
to “Paano Ako Naging Leading Lady.”

00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:23.833
It was a one-act play,
and it became a full-blown musical.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.377
There are also one-act plays
that became films.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.815
So it achieved a full-length status,
I mean relatively.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.012
For example “Imbisibol”,
it was a one-act play.

00:06:39.037 --> 00:06:41.607
But when it was
translated into film

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:49.007
it became a presentation of a milieu.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:52.044
Something like that,
so it’s possible.

00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:55.474
- But that’s expanding
on the same topic? Or...?

00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:56.615
Yes,

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:06.714
but again, like I said, it’s no guarantee
that it’ll be successful aesthetically

00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:15.712
- Will you be able to help us?
In developing a full-length?

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.434
I mean, do you have anything to share,
not necessarily right now,

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:25.809
some exercises or strategies
on how to develop or...

00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:28.263
or expand,

00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:31.449
Or does it really start
with what you want to say,

00:07:31.474 --> 00:07:34.427
and it has to be
something that’s grand and...?

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:36.411
It’s not just the grandness.

00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:38.302
But the...

00:07:38.548 --> 00:07:42.611
It’s also an exercise
and skill in developing ideas.

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:47.455
Because in a one-act,
like what I said,

00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:54.109
you still follow one path
which is still an effort to do.

00:07:54.914 --> 00:08:03.723
Especially when it’s a bit sensitive
or the topic is controversial,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.776
but if it’s like “That’s all I have
to say about this,”

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.623
that’s what’ll happen.

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:13.116
I guess it’s the same example as

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.565
will you write a short story
or will you write a novel?

00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:21.821
That the effort will be
much more daunting.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.002
The project will be
much more daunting if it’s a novel.

00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:31.976
Because you can come up
with more related ideas.

00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:38.661
You can put subplots, parallel plots

00:08:39.607 --> 00:08:42.560
to elaborate more on the ideas.

00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:47.067
It could be the same idea
as your first one-act play,

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:51.065
it only means that when you’re
developing a full-length,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.369
you’re developing
the idea much more.

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:58.996
Subjecting it
to more complex contexts, right?

00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:04.585
One of the tendencies,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.402
especially if you’re used
to writing one-act plays,

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:11.482
when making a full-length,
is to create three one-acts.

00:09:12.638 --> 00:09:15.420
It becomes something
like a trilogy of characters.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.405
It becomes something like that, right?

00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:21.324
Like comparing three lives

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:24.458
but actually there are
three one-act plays.

00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:26.193
You can do it that way,

00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:32.486
but it’s also possible
that you followed all of it.

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:36.669
So I guess...

00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:42.238
since many of the writers
are joining Virgin Labfest,

00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:44.550
since that’s the only venue,

00:09:45.374 --> 00:09:51.959
it would be a good exercise
for writers like you to push for it,

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:56.359
to develop the ideas.

00:09:57.727 --> 00:10:00.272
- So usually you tend
to make a big one-act…

00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:07.315
that’s why one-acts
were more exciting before.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.737
Yes, because it loses something like...

00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:15.911
It’s like you made an espresso,
but you just added water so it’s like...

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.782
- The effect of the 
(espresso) shot is gone--

00:10:17.807 --> 00:10:24.636
- The caffeine's effect is lost
when it becomes a full-length.

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:25.898
That’s true.

00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:33.467
The easier way
is to treat it as telenovela, right?

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:35.818
Like films that were
turned into telenovelas, right?

00:10:35.857 --> 00:10:40.366
The way they expand it,
it’s really like adding water.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.842
So the story becomes diluted, not--

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:47.223
and lengthy, nothing more.

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:49.640
But that’s not what
we want to happen.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:52.053
We don't want
to just make it longer.

00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:54.820
We also want
to make it profound.
