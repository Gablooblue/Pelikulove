00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:15.480
How about stereotypical characters?

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:20.974
They become stereotypes

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:26.115
because we have
the same impression of them.

00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:28.565
For example,

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:35.972
the prostitute with a golden heart
has become a stereotype.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:44.645
This is what we encounter
in many plays and films today.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:49.427
Not all--

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:54.040
They become stereotypes
because we create the impression

00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:57.239
that all characters
like that are similar.

00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:04.844
In the tradition of showing that kind
of character, a writer will say,

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:10.210
"No, I'll create a prostitute who's like this."

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.467
I'll make her a witch.

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:21.666
So she'll create distinct traits
for the prostitute

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:28.054
to first change the perception
of others on that character

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.969
while being integral to her story.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:43.081
That's where you'll see
how the character will react

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.083
because you gave
her various traits

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:50.807
that could either ruin

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:54.211
or give her a chance
to get what she wants.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.079
When that's clear,
the character will seem complex

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:06.531
and not just because
she thinks a certain way.

00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:09.216
The problem with stereotypical characters

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.504
is that their decision
and response to a situation

00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.514
become stereotypical as well.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.897
What'll break that impression
is if you give them unique traits

00:02:26.962 --> 00:02:30.061
which could trigger
a different response

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.463
to the situation
you put them in.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.949
That's easy to say,
of course

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:42.525
but you're facing up to...

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.103
Like what Jmee said,

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:49.009
she grew up in 2018
where there are so many shows,

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:54.046
so many films, so many plays

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:58.963
that if you made one of these,
you'll think it's original

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:01.732
but the audience will say,
"I've already seen that!"

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.749
So should you be original?

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:08.496
Or should you tweak it,
or ride with it?

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.971
Or can you revise
an existing work?

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:21.964
In music, there are only eight notes.

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:27.661
But look how much music
humanity has created.

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:30.774
I guess it's also similar

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:34.520
to making a play or
writing a story.

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:40.459
Some say there are
actually only 52 plotlines

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:47.201
or story configurations
that could ever happen.

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.191
But how many stories
have we got?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.184
How many folktales
have been told?

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:57.407
How many plays
have been created?

00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:05.815
It won't add to the originality
of your character

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:08.133
if you know your character
inside and out

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.324
as though she were a living person.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:13.902
For me, it doesn’t really
make so much sense.

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.302
In the first place,
I'm not Frankenstein

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.579
to create people.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.628
For what?

00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:24.697
I have a story to tell.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:27.371
That doesn’t mean

00:04:27.397 --> 00:04:30.504
you’re going to use
stereotypical characters,

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:35.456
or cardboard characters.

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:39.453
What I'm saying is,

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.933
the character will be
fleshed out eventually,

00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:45.808
her personality will emerge
when you put her in a situation,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.352
when you see how she'll react.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.596
So again, what's her objective?

00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.755
and what's hindering
that objective?

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.844
You'll provide all of those

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:06.245
It's like you're fighting
with yourself.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.999
You want the character to win,

00:05:10.174 --> 00:05:15.741
but you're also laying out the traps
So she doesn't achieve it.

00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:20.657
It's also you who'll dictate
if she gets what she wants or not,

00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:24.658
after you weigh out her capacities.

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:29.763
Is she Superwoman to carry the world?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.325
Or is she just a kid

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:39.836
who simply wants
to win the elocution contest?

00:05:41.698 --> 00:05:43.965
That's what'll dictate your story.

00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:46.298
Do you have questions?

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:51.529
May: This is always my problem
when I'm writing characters

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.291
especially with using stereotypes.

00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:58.978
How do you make
a stereotypical character work?

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:03.589
RV: In Nick Joaquin's plays,

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:09.888
because I had the honor of writing
the introduction to his plays,

00:06:09.913 --> 00:06:13.057
when I was reading his plays,

00:06:13.082 --> 00:06:16.050
I noticed that he was actually
using stereotypical characters,

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.641
but putting them
in different situations

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:25.745
and making them react differently
from how we would normally expect

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:28.462
from such a stereotypical character.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.545
There are two old maids in "Larawan."

00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:36.379
Usually, the stereotypical objective

00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:42.167
of two old maids is to find a husband,

00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:45.907
even if late in life.

00:06:45.932 --> 00:06:48.606
But then he put them in a situation

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:51.098
where they needed to work,

00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:54.112
they had to take care
of their dying father,

00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:58.383
and then there’s this painting
that’s becoming such a big burden to them.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:09.316
And so they started to solve
all these obstacles along the way.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.652
While in "Tatarin,"

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.418
there's the stereotypical
hysterical woman

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:22.438
who came to town,
who went wild and so on.

00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:23.962
But then you realize,

00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:28.870
he wants to say something
to patriarchal society.

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:34.066
There's also the prostitute
with a golden heart

00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:45.660
who seems like a gold-digger,
but actually isn't.

00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:48.040
In effect, during this time,

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:49.450
of course, when you release it now

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.068
there's a bit of stereotyping

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.891
because a lot of people
have done that in the past.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.525
But Nick probably broke it
during his time.

00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:08.026
I think there are many strategies
approaching that.

00:08:08.107 --> 00:08:14.032
One is when you break
the expectations of the audience

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:15.735
about a stereotypical character.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:19.097
Let's say a gay man
dressing up as a woman.

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:25.255
How do you go about breaking
the stereotypical expectation?

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:29.080
A stereotype will work
as a stereotype

00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:32.850
if you fulfill the expectation
of the one watching.

00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:39.421
You'll break that
and create a new character

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:45.040
if you don't do what they expect.

00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:48.498
Migy: Will it not run counter--

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:53.124
won't they question
how realistic it should be?

00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:56.865
"It should be like this
in real life, not like that."

00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:58.022
How do we approach that?

00:08:58.258 --> 00:09:05.599
RV: No, because you still need
to find a way to make it believable.

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:07.735
It means you have to set it up.

00:09:07.774 --> 00:09:10.999
For example,
the stereotypical character...

00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:12.714
the gay man who dresses up
as a woman.

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:14.685
What's the stereotypical notion of that?

00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:15.684
He's weak.

00:09:17.326 --> 00:09:23.485
But then there are other characters
who are able to defend themselves.

00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:26.013
There's the Thai boxer.

00:09:27.412 --> 00:09:28.637
The beautiful boxer.

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:40.222
It means the character himself
breaks his stereotypical image.

00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:45.196
Because the stereotypical quality
of any character

00:09:45.221 --> 00:09:48.897
is buttressed on the expectation
of the audience.

00:09:52.227 --> 00:09:53.730
Actually, with what you're saying,

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:56.807
not all unconventional characters are like that,

00:09:57.592 --> 00:10:01.444
and this could happen
if the situation is like this.

00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:07.458
You can look at it as though
your character is some sort of routine.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.244
For example,

00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:15.730
What's your routine
in the morning?

00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:18.295
When you wake up?

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:24.631
- Drink a glass of water right away.

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:27.851
Water right away?
And then?

00:10:29.314 --> 00:10:30.231
- I wash my face.

00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:33.107
- Take a bath.

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:35.230
You don’t eat first?

00:10:36.378 --> 00:10:42.685
The meal and bath, depends.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.904
So it could be either?
But the first thing is water?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.298
- And then wash my face.

00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:53.198
The routine of this character is

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.869
when he wakes up,
he's still groggy

00:10:57.894 --> 00:11:00.516
and then heads to the sink
to drink water.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.586
After that, he'll go to the bathroom,

00:11:04.737 --> 00:11:09.649
wash his face
and then take a bath.

00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:12.793
How to break the routine is,

00:11:12.832 --> 00:11:16.131
when you wake up in the morning
there's no water

00:11:23.885 --> 00:11:27.919
or when he opens the faucet
mud comes out.

00:11:29.409 --> 00:11:30.268
"What's that?"
Like that.

00:11:30.294 --> 00:11:33.607
Migy: In stereotypical characters,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:41.144
it’s the situation
that the writers are putting them in,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.625
they will change the entire character.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.391
Probably the situation,
that’s one strategy.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:51.443
Another situation is how
they will react to that situation.

00:11:52.927 --> 00:12:03.127
In fact, most plays with
post-modern tendencies

00:12:03.252 --> 00:12:06.258
use stereotypical characters.

00:12:06.283 --> 00:12:15.239
Then they're placed in an off-putting situation
so they clash with the whole situation.

00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:21.042
Like putting
a Sandra Dee character

00:12:21.183 --> 00:12:23.850
in a punk situation

00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:26.315
which may be funny
but at the same time

00:12:26.369 --> 00:12:29.546
it breaks certain
stereotypical expectations.

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:34.633
There are plenty of strategies.

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:39.109
There's one where you have
to change the character inside and out.

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:46.162
The character's pulling a cutesy Sandra Dee
because she's actually a robber.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.855
That's another way of creating a break
in the stereotypical image.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.047
What you did is you changed her occupation.

00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:00.782
Situations like that

00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:04.545
where you put them there
and see their reactions

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.758
are ways of breaking that stereotype.

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:08.695
And there're so many ways.

00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:10.251
But then again

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:12.178
you also have to bear in mind

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:20.573
that stereotypical qualities
become stereotypical in time.

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:26.680
The more times you use it,
the more they become stereotypical.

00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:34.088
And then the more reason
for you to break them.

00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:37.493
Sometimes it reverts back

00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:45.624
because the audience hasn't seen
the old stereotype for a while

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:52.313
That's why there are remakes
and the nostalgia.
