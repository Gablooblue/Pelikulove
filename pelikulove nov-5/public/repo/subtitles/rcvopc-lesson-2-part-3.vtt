00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.295
This scene includes
Barbara and Erps.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.004
Erbs?

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:18.645
Erps.

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:20.919
Barbara: "What a nice plate!"

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:23.215
Erps: "That's from Ardy."

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.862
Barbara: "Are you okay?"

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:26.097
Erps: "Getting there."

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:28.395
"It's just that this plate,"

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.339
"I remember we bought it
at Dimensione."

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:33.878
"We bought an entire set
when we moved here."

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:35.888
Barbara: "Look, this one still
has its price tag"

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:37.870
"but says it's from 'SM Home World'."

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:39.787
Erps: "Really?"

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:41.767
Barbara will show the plate to Erps.

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:43.701
Erps: "Oh yeah, wait."

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.314
"I remember that was from Dimensione.
He requested that."

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.082
"I was late and he'd already
chosen a design."

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:52.367
"He even fought with me
because I was late."

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:55.116
"So this is what we bought."

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:58.122
Barbara: "But it says 'SM Home World'."

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:03.023
Erps: "Oh right,
I was with someone else."

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.425
Barbara: "Uh huh."

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:08.097
Barbara is a black girl.

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.082
Erps: "Oh yeah,"

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:13.101
"it's when my friends came over
and I wanted to prepare something"

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.592
"but I didn't want
to use paper plates."

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.010
"I went with someone
to SM Home World."

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:19.989
"We bought the cheapest set
of plates and utensils."

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.570
"It's such a hassle
'cause we just rode a train."

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:27.432
"We braved the crowd while holding the plates,
making sure we didn't bump anyone."

00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:30.156
That's where the scene ends.

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.739
Very interesting.

00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:42.656
I find it very interesting.

00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:48.447
You were able to manifest-

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.509
Of course I understand,
the scene is just starting

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.779
but it's going somewhere nice.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:04.362
The attack to grief was tangential.

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:08.017
But at the same time,
grief and forgetfulness

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.541
interweaved smoothly.

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.686
He remembers the time

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.178
they bought plates together.

00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:16.724
It just so happened

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:19.283
that wasn't the plate they bought.

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:22.450
So therefore, forgetting

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:25.345
that detail

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.253
says something.

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:34.159
Maybe that's where the topic
is going until he realizes

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:37.673
the memory is gradually fading.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.352
Okay. Next.

00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:46.806
In the living room, Ramil and Julio
are at both ends of the sofa.

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:49.396
They're watching TV.

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:51.623
The remote control
is at the center table.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.884
Julio gets the remote control.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.648
Julio: "Can you switch
to the basket ball game"

00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:57.999
"while it's still on commercial?"

00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:01.489
Ramil switches back
to the first channel

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.600
Ramil: "No."

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:06.062
Little by little,
they move closer to each other.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:07.435
Julio changes it again.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.824
Julio: "The commercials are still on."

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.215
Ramil switches it back again.

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.137
Ramil: "I don't want to miss out.
It's my favorite show."

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.177
Julio switches
the channel again.

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.920
Julio: "So what if you miss a little?"

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:19.532
"Are you president
of its fans club?"

00:03:19.802 --> 00:03:21.932
Ramil stands up and so does Julio.

00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:25.398
Ramil: "That's how I am.
I only want to focus on what I want."

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:28.511
Julio: "Why, you think when you switch
channels, you'll lose interest?"

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.424
"That you can't go back anymore?
Is that it?"

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.870
Ramil: "Maybe you're used to that."

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:38.387
"Used to multitasking everything,
watching TV and relationships."

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.570
Julio gets the remote control,
turns the TV off.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.663
He looks at Ramil for a long time.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.832
Antoinette Jadaone.

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.078
- What channels were those?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.194
Maybe there were just two.

00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:56.387
Just buy another TV.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.109
Nice use of object

00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:07.763
to deflect the issue

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:11.242
to something more palpable.

00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:18.320
I wasn't able to write
the stage direction yet.

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.027
But basically the premise
is there're two characters

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.743
A mom and a daughter.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.908
The daughter is off to work

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.701
and there's a dress code.

00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:32.452
Her mom sees her wearing heels.

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:34.830
Then the scene starts.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.739
Mom: "You're wearing that
to work?"

00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:39.599
Points at the heels
of her daughter.

00:04:39.822 --> 00:04:41.387
Daughter: "Why not?"

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:44.165
Mom: "You need to be careful,
you might trip.

00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:46.507
Daughter: "This is part
of the dress code for work."

00:04:46.532 --> 00:04:50.770
"If I don't wear this,
I might get penalized and a salary cut."

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:54.066
"I've already incurred so many penalties.
I don't want to get laid off."

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:58.118
Mom: "Just talk to your boss.
He'll understand your situation."

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:00.240
Daughter: "It's only been
a month, Mom."

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.213
Mom: "You still need
to be careful."

00:05:02.487 --> 00:05:05.608
"Stay there, I'll get
your flats so you can change."

00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:06.917
Daughter: "Mom,"

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:08.458
"I'm not ready yet."

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.190
Pause.

00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:11.615
Mom: "What did you say?"

00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:14.538
Daughter: "I don't want to--
I'm not ready."

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.020
Mom: "What do you mean
you're not ready?"

00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:18.801
"You're a woman.
God made you for this."

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:22.528
Daughter: "This is keeping me from
doing the things I still want to do."

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:24.625
"I can't even follow
the dress code because of this."

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.500
"And now, I might get fired."

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.602
"Where are we going
to get money, then?"

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:30.319
Mom: "Don't think like that."

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:31.979
"It's natural for a woman
to be a mother.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:36.049
"I was able to raise you
even when I got pregnant early."

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:38.307
"You can do it too."

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:40.937
Daughter: "But did you ever ask me if I wanted this?"

00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:42.569
That's it.

00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.946
So the object
here is the heels.

00:05:47.078 --> 00:05:49.980
And the issue started
with the use of the heels.

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:54.984
So, it's like this.

00:05:55.215 --> 00:05:59.764
Just to explain the flow
of the whole process,

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.904
if you really did your homework.

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:07.047
I really want you
to see the process

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.671
that a writer goes through

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.578
when fascinated by a topic.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.376
So I let you write
about your beliefs.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:21.989
That's you as a writer.

00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:26.144
But you're not the only one
in this world.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:29.701
There will always be people
who'll disagree with your opinions.

00:06:29.858 --> 00:06:31.792
It's important to know that.

00:06:33.157 --> 00:06:34.567
Face that fact

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:36.120
and embrace it.

00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:44.177
This other side of the topic

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:51.094
will give you the reason
to continue the story.

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:54.467
In fact, this will start
your story's conflict.

00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:59.246
You won't get sources
for a conflict

00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:08.215
if you'll only use
your opinion and principles.

00:07:08.332 --> 00:07:10.590
Just make a personal essay, then,

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:14.319
where you won't have enemies
but yourself.

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:22.380
Here, we're looking for a way
to convince viewers

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.497
that there could be something

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.941
right and wrong on this side
as well as on the other.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:34.826
But show it,
through dynamic development,

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.307
how this progresses.

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:42.706
In the third step,

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:49.072
it's still you contemplating,
but in dialogue form.

00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:53.365
That's also important because

00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:58.717
you'll be forced to organize
your arguments and thoughts

00:07:58.898 --> 00:08:01.209
until you reach the climax.

00:08:01.957 --> 00:08:03.572
That's going to be your template.

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:06.201
When you reach
the fourth step,

00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:10.795
you detach yourselves
and find a character

00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:19.420
to dramatize the debate
being talked about.

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.911
The reason why
I required an object

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:41.955
was to draw you away
from the debate on the topic

00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:46.972
because what we're trying
to create is a situation

00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:50.889
where the topic will
naturally come out,

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:56.161
without explicitly
talking about it.

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:58.069
But we still get it.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.109
That’s the significance of the object.

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:06.003
A lot of you said,
"I don’t know where this scene will go."

00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:10.604
But you still managed
to talk about it

00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:14.304
without outrightly saying

00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:18.157
the way you're saying it
when you were debating with yourself.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.545
I guess that’s
an important component

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.045
in writing a play.

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.306
Although you want
to say something,

00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:37.510
how will you implicitly
deliver your message?

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:48.474
How will you convey it without using
the keywords in your mind?

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:54.990
And one particular
useful device

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:02.900
is to throw in an object
that these characters will negotiate.

00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:09.318
Objects are used
in almost any play

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:10.996
that has ever been written

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.307
because it pushes action.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:23.428
Shakespeare used a handkerchief,
dagger, sword, skull...

00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:27.646
Through his usage
of these objects,

00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:38.083
the ideas and concepts
become more palpable, more tactile.

00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:49.982
Whether it's a dog, an argument
on child custody, to a missing key...

00:10:53.312 --> 00:10:59.522
This is one important device
that people use.

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:05.120
Another reason why I added the
object as a requirement

00:11:05.217 --> 00:11:10.519
is because it forces
the characters

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.827
to confront the present.

00:11:19.748 --> 00:11:22.424
This prompts them

00:11:24.494 --> 00:11:26.056
to look for a solution

00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:31.009
to the problem
or impetus of the object.

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:36.099
That’s the downside.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.834
When you want to talk about
what you want to talk about so strongly,

00:11:40.932 --> 00:11:46.103
you feel so strongly about this
and it has to be said over and over,

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.417
it might sound
like a manifesto.

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.984
I asked you to do a manifesto

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:53.125
but that’s different
from doing a play.

00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:59.704
And one way to occlude that

00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:02.310
is to throw in an object.

00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:05.338
Why? Because it
pushes characters

00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:08.158
to be at the present time

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:14.088
and not talk about
their own feelings.

00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:17.008
Nothing will happen
if they just talk.

00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:21.988
But when you put an object
then that object becomes...

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.686
an impetus

00:12:26.233 --> 00:12:30.122
to push the story forward

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:35.387
at the same time
reveal the characters’ feelings,

00:12:35.777 --> 00:12:37.972
their beliefs or stances,

00:12:38.682 --> 00:12:42.811
their opinions or truths.

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:47.242
And many times,

00:12:47.609 --> 00:12:52.032
it is the cleverness
of the choice of that object

00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:55.394
which can stand
also as a metaphor.

00:12:56.034 --> 00:12:58.709
Like for example,
"The Glass Menagerie"

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.045
where the woman’s glass collection

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:06.841
had a huge impact on the story.

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:10.073
Or a woman selling flowers,

00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:12.658
"Flores Para Los Muertos".

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:16.270
Tennessee Williams, for example,

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:18.869
is good in using different objects.

00:13:18.894 --> 00:13:20.176
A telegram

00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:27.154
can make or break
the character.

00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:32.776
That’s the significance

00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:36.191
of seemingly unimportant objects,

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:39.634
where all of a sudden, they're the ones
that push the action

00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:46.885
and demand from the characters
to confront themselves, their issues.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.847
If you notice most titles

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:58.206
of plays and movies use objects.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.371
"The Red Violin",
"The Scarlet Letter",

00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:03.691
"The House with Seven Gables"

00:14:03.716 --> 00:14:05.714
It's been that way ever since.

00:14:05.755 --> 00:14:09.760
Let’s now go to the main craft.

00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:18.488
Your philosophies and beliefs in life
are things I can't teach you.

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:22.714
Because these
are your experiences.

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:27.295
It took you years to understand
and believe in them.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.569
These are your truth claims.

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:35.036
If they were just opinions,
then they wouldn’t be compelling enough

00:14:35.162 --> 00:14:37.397
for you to write about them.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.449
Again, we go back to what you
really want to write about.

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:43.949
It's not just really want.

00:14:45.725 --> 00:14:46.739
It's more than that.

00:14:46.912 --> 00:14:49.173
It’s a truth claim
that you have had.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.842
I can't teach you these things.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.475
It has to come from you.

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:57.201
But you're right,
it can still change.

00:14:58.134 --> 00:15:01.882
In fact, his perspective changed
during the writing process.

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:09.132
For all you know,
it’s the play that will help you

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:16.983
change your views
about certain things.

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:22.850
Especially if your play
requires some research.

00:15:24.903 --> 00:15:26.914
You might realize
something's wrong.

00:15:26.979 --> 00:15:29.670
- Is it possible, for the
whole duration of the play,

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:34.054
to never reach
the conceptual debate?

00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:36.223
Never reach what?

00:15:36.248 --> 00:15:42.372
The debate we did in exercise 3.

00:15:43.183 --> 00:15:44.532
It just remains a concept?

00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:48.383
- Yes. In fact, it's a take off.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:52.164
But you should never lose sight
of what you want to say.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.427
It should still be there.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.044
You just find ways of saying

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:57.310
what you want to say
without saying it.

00:15:57.813 --> 00:16:02.927
- So you can finish the play
without mentioning that it's about-

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.302
It's about this.
But it's the audience who says,

00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:07.740
"What's the play about?"
"About grief."

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.412
That’s the mark or indicator
that you succeeded as a writer

00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:18.955
because you were able to say
what you want to say about grieving

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.170
without explicitly saying it.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.353
Because you used
other ways to convey it.

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:29.709
Your take off
might have been the plate.

00:16:33.663 --> 00:16:41.248
That’s the cleverness or deft of hand.

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:45.083
That’s where you create the magic.
