00:00:15.597 --> 00:00:17.707
Have you written your story?

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.898
Are you done?

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.398
Okay,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.581
 this will be your basis.

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:31.026
The storyline that you wrote

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.972
will be the basis for the play’s form.

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:42.385
So we’re just two steps away

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:47.964
before going into the actual
writing of the dialogue.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:55.762
This is so it’s clear to you
what the conventional process is.

00:00:55.858 --> 00:01:00.537
For beginners,

00:01:01.773 --> 00:01:05.465
this is my recommendation.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.161
At the least.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.457
For more organized thoughts,

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.418
for a more organized story.

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:18.627
Or you could use a structure

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.833
in order to highlight

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:28.879
several emotional moments.

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:33.669
if that’s what you want as a writer.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:38.903
When will your audience be moved?
When will they be hooked?

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:45.730
And how will you keep them
interested ‘til the end?

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:53.656
This is the difference of a storyline
with what you will be doing next,

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.453
which is called a scenario.

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:03.159
Its development
from story to scenario –

00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:08.508
this is where your imagination
as a playwright comes in.

00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:12.255
This is something
that will help mark your play.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:20.011
Your story could be based
from real life or from a book.

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.301
The story may not be original,

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:30.212
but the difference
is in how you tell the story.

00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:33.347
Of course, the most conventional story
originated from long ago.

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:39.962
That’s the classic,
standard way of telling a story.

00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:44.401
From a long time ago.
Like this, and that.

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:47.955
But not all of our stories are legends.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.733
We have different ways

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.200
of telling stories.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.492
And sometimes
in telling these stories,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.090
it somehow gives writers an idea
of the different styles that can be used

00:03:09.192 --> 00:03:11.538
Should I tell the story through songs?

00:03:11.595 --> 00:03:13.165
Then it’s a musical.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.783
Through spoken word?

00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:20.053
Will I tell the story

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:27.256
through different characters?

00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:33.446
For example, instead of people
I’ll use animals to tell the story.

00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:38.718
So I can show the savagery
 in human beings.

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:43.545
So the content of the story
is integrated with how you tell the story.

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:54.911
Nowadays, we see a lot of films
that change or tweak stories.

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:58.355
For example, something
as simple as Snow White.

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:05.669
Instead of Snow White,
the story's about the witch.

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:09.406
Or in Sleeping Beauty's story

00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.999
but the focus is on the queen witch.

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:19.736
Why did the queen witch
curse Sleeping Beauty?

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.459
So this is--

00:04:23.748 --> 00:04:30.867
One way of tweaking a story
is by changing the story’s point of view.

00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:37.328
By doing that, you’re changing
the conventional structure of the story.

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.318
You’re not changing
the actual story,

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:44.686
just looking at it
through a different lens.

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.993
And that’s part
of making the scenario.

00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:53.194
In creating a scenario,
you have to decide:

00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.733
Where do I start the story?

00:04:55.812 --> 00:04:59.774
Do I start from the point
where my character is born?

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.499
Or do I start at that point
where she’s close

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:08.813
close to reaching what she wants?

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:11.741
But she’s already there

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:15.890
almost a step,
two steps away

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:21.495
from facing her rival.

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:25.916
You decide that.

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:32.638
This is what we call
choosing the point of attack.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:37.524
It's not necessary
to start from the top

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.236
especially for one-act plays

00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.128
or short plays
that have one setting

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:46.827
and need to end right away.

00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:55.500
You won’t start this
at the lowest part of the story,

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.710
but at the highest part ,

00:05:58.803 --> 00:06:02.038
near the climax of the story.

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.272
And after that,

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.654
in the course
of that short one-act play,

00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:11.860
relevant parts
of the story should be told

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:15.653
for the audience
to understand what’s going on.

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:23.216
Usually, one-act plays
don’t start at the very beginning.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.559
So there are different
ways of doing it,

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:28.139
especially the flavor.

00:06:28.164 --> 00:06:30.508
This is where cooking comes in

00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:35.460
how you cook

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.067
the adobo matters.

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.864
It has more ingredients.

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:42.824
At the same time,
the kare-kare is hyped.

00:06:42.862 --> 00:06:44.760
There are different ways of cooking it.

00:06:44.785 --> 00:06:49.394
Even when you look up a recipe,

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.167
There are different ways
of cooking the actual food.

00:06:52.223 --> 00:06:56.209
It’s the same way
with cooking up a story.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.917
But whatever happens,

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:04.016
the story will only end
when the conflict ends.

00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:06.842
It’s so easy
to talk about it, right?

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:10.212
But there are times--
there are many writers

00:07:10.237 --> 00:07:12.678
that don’t exactly know the conflict

00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:14.496
and if it’ll end or not.

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:20.961
Sometimes, they have so much to say
that they end up unsure

00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:25.250
as to how the play will end.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.657
So there’s a huge difference
between the story and the plot.

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:35.233
You created the story

00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:36.729
from the beginning.

00:07:36.754 --> 00:07:40.168
CJ’s relationship with Mateo.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.460
Masi with Dan.

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:46.306
Rob and Avic.

00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:49.507
Enna and Cyril.

00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:52.267
Or the mother and daughter.

00:07:56.741 --> 00:08:01.199
Agapito Flores and Graham Bell.

00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:03.458
They're not a pair, right?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.220
You still have to look for it.

00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:08.871
The problem is the character
or inventor who'll move the story forward.

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:10.869
For example, the inventor.

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:14.755
The inventor and the world.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.879
It's so huge.

00:08:20.297 --> 00:08:21.398
Which is why,

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:25.992
 the smaller the problem,
the faster it is to resolve.

00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:29.668
That’s what will also set

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.786
the length, depth,
and scope of the story.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:38.126
There are also lengthy plays of course.

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.476
Other writers see that

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:44.515
tracking or chronicling the life

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.003
of a character lasts years.

00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:57.742
Some of Bertolt Brecht’s plays
are good examples of this.

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:02.405
An example is his play “Galileo,”

00:09:02.858 --> 00:09:06.296
which isn’t actually
about Galileo’s life.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:13.281
Though a huge part of it
tackled 20 years, 25-30 years of his life

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:18.659
from his discovery
of the possibility

00:09:18.722 --> 00:09:21.998
that it wasn't...

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.316
the sun and the planets
 that orbited the earth.

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.975
The conclusion of the story

00:09:32.024 --> 00:09:35.749
is his recantation

00:09:36.682 --> 00:09:39.905
 and declaration
that his discovery was wrong.

00:09:40.024 --> 00:09:45.228
That was what
the whole play was about.

00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:50.681
And it chronicled his life
until he was about 60 years old.

00:09:50.817 --> 00:09:52.936
He didn't get what he want.

00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:56.108
The character, Galileo,
compromised

00:09:56.155 --> 00:09:58.446
and he was guilty of it.

00:09:58.485 --> 00:10:00.283
He was aware
of that compromise.

00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:05.009
When the battle ends,

00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:06.755
when someone succeeds,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.443
it doesn’t necessarily mean
that your character has to win.

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:13.207
Even when the conflict ends,
it’s possible to have no winners at all.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.654
When the conflict is resolved,

00:10:17.789 --> 00:10:21.042
it doesn’t mean
it has to end positively.

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:26.859
In “Mother Courage”,
it spanned for almost 30 years.

00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:30.215
Mother Courage has three children.

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:34.706
In the duration of the play,

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:36.148
we see her children
die one by one.

00:10:36.174 --> 00:10:38.519
The story’s that simple.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:42.885
Actually, Mother Courage
sells war materials.

00:10:44.118 --> 00:10:48.584
One of her children went to war
and became a soldier.

00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:53.227
Her other child
became a treasurer in the army

00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.360
And her mute child

00:10:56.416 --> 00:11:03.120
saved a town by beating drums.

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:08.706
When that was done,
the play ended and she was alone.

00:11:09.223 --> 00:11:12.566
That was the whole story of the play.

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:15.160
But it tackled a lot of themes

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:22.244
about war, business,
the integration of capitalism with war,

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:24.069
and why these are important

00:11:24.094 --> 00:11:26.645
 to discuss together
and not as separate issues.

00:11:27.056 --> 00:11:31.619
And what its consequences
are to the people.

00:11:31.643 --> 00:11:32.969
It talks about a lot,

00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:35.870
but it’s just a story
about the family.

00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:41.470
So if you notice,
a story can be simple,

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:43.820
but you can also elaborate it

00:11:44.607 --> 00:11:47.241
through creating scenarios.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.178
These scenarios are what
the audience will see onstage.

00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:57.330
That’s what they’ll see.

00:11:57.752 --> 00:12:01.559
It won’t be me
narrating my story to you.

00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:07.254
It won’t be me
pitching an important story.

00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:13.368
This is more like, “Oh the story is good,
but how will we watch this?”

00:12:14.979 --> 00:12:18.971
This is where we see
the skill of the playwright.

00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:21.838
If the story is yours,

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:26.698
then you’re lucky
 have a good story.

00:12:26.744 --> 00:12:30.744
But how will you deliver the story?

00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:34.471
This is where being
a playwright comes in.

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:39.495
Like what I said, the storytelling
is different when you write this in a book

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.188
or you made it a novel,

00:12:41.213 --> 00:12:46.429
or as a short story
versus dramatizing it.

00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:51.083
This is finally the mark

00:12:51.117 --> 00:12:58.669
or demarcation where we’re entering
the first phase of actual playwriting.

00:12:58.884 --> 00:13:02.539
This is where you check
every scene that’s needed

00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:07.928
so you can tell
the story of your play,

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:12.563
introduce the main characters
and the support and bit roles

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:17.007
and put in the obstacles
at the right time,

00:13:17.032 --> 00:13:20.316
since timing is important.

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:27.603
Now, there are different ways
of storytelling through chronology.

00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:32.164
One example
is Harold Pinter’s play “Betrayal”

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:39.718
in which he reversed the chronology
of the story about an affair.

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.435
It started

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:45.985
at the end of the affair,
when the lovers are about to break up.

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:54.674
We follow the next scenes
going backwards in time

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:57.215
until we reach the last scene,

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.194
when the lovers first met

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.158
and had their first kiss.

00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:07.370
The impact

00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:10.278
is different

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:12.202
because

00:14:12.531 --> 00:14:18.949
it’s clear that Harold Pinter’s intention
isn’t to make us giddy about the kiss,

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:22.742
but to show that

00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:26.272
the kiss is the result of lust.

00:14:28.802 --> 00:14:33.814
This is what’s called dramatic irony
and it's an important aspect

00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:37.347
since the audience knows

00:14:37.385 --> 00:14:39.170
they’ll split up in the end

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:42.452
because of the first act,

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.365
the impact is different.

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:47.721
So, of course, that’s a very, very,

00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:53.489
very unique way of telling the story.

00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:56.617
And like what I said,

00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:01.574
you can only do
those kinds of tricks once.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:06.114
But what a wonderful,
clever way to tell a story.

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:10.020
Because what’s important
isn’t just the story itself,

00:15:10.064 --> 00:15:17.642
but how the playwright
plays with your perception.

00:15:19.393 --> 00:15:24.552
What if you already know
what’s going to happen even before it starts?

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:30.992
You won’t just feel
love or giddiness,

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:37.213
but also sadness, and so on.

00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:45.520
Those are what you have
to take into account when creating scenarios.

00:15:46.127 --> 00:15:54.275
This is where what you want to say
comes in and how you’re going to tell the story.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.808
We’re still at the level
where you’re touched with the material.

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:03.990
You just have to organize it
so it’s clearer

00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:06.890
and to choose the character

00:16:06.969 --> 00:16:09.125
that’ll move the
scenario forward.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.951
This is how you’ll tell the story.

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:17.771
There are plays that

00:16:17.796 --> 00:16:23.034
don’t have a clear structure,
but it actually does have one.

00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:26.480
When I wrote the play
“Ralph and Claudia”

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:31.333
about the development
of a transgender person,

00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:37.091
I was inspired
from a lot of sources.

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:39.570
Even with forming the structure.

00:16:39.637 --> 00:16:41.089
The play originated

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:47.984
from an imaginary television interview
at a mountaintop in Batanes.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:52.734
The interviewer is the protagonist

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.560
and he interviewed three

00:16:55.856 --> 00:17:03.634
known legends, either mythical,
or a popular news item.

00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:09.478
Nancy is a runner, an athlete

00:17:11.183 --> 00:17:14.747
whose sexuality is doubted.

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:18.479
But she still joined
the women’s category.

00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:22.889
Eventually, people found out
that she had hypospadias.

00:17:22.924 --> 00:17:23.974
This means,

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:27.464
they couldn’t determine
what her sex organ is.

00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:30.486
But then the committee decided

00:17:30.538 --> 00:17:33.403
that Nancy was male
so she was disqualified.

00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:37.574
My other play was inspired
from a Kung Fu film.

00:17:38.744 --> 00:17:45.644
It’s about a guy who wants to be
the best Kung Fu master.

00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:49.111
But in order to be a master

00:17:49.172 --> 00:17:53.176
he has to sacrifice his genital
and become a woman.

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:55.557
This is from a Chinese
Kung Fu movie

00:17:55.582 --> 00:17:57.066
and what I used for satire.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.892
My third play

00:17:57.917 --> 00:18:00.512
is about...

00:18:02.855 --> 00:18:04.487
about...

00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:09.149
a man being haunted
by an apartment ghost.

00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:13.948
And he wants to know
if the ghost is a man or a woman

00:18:13.973 --> 00:18:16.597
because he’s falling
in love with the ghost.

00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:19.881
But the ghost
doesn’t want to reveal

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.858
if he’s a man or a woman.

00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:23.955
That’s what the interview’s about.

00:18:24.094 --> 00:18:25.830
After that scene,

00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:30.205
we head over to the story
of the actual interviewer.

00:18:31.214 --> 00:18:34.147
We go through his story
from being a man

00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:39.034
to him thinking he was gay

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:42.447
until he finally realized
that he was a woman.

00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:44.695
The interviewer
underwent sex change.

00:18:44.772 --> 00:18:50.858
And when she changed her sex,
she then realized that she liked women.

00:18:50.918 --> 00:18:55.666
And so she ended up
becoming a transexual lesbian.

00:18:56.411 --> 00:19:01.569
The interviewer experienced
the boy, girl, lesbian, and gay stereotypes.

00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:03.655
But if you watch it,
you might end up asking,

00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:05.213
“Where’s the structure?”

00:19:05.238 --> 00:19:06.352
In fact,

00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:08.878
that’s what I feel is the structure.

00:19:08.903 --> 00:19:11.631
I decided to start
with the interviewer’s imagination.

00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:12.759
And then

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:17.635
I chose four scenes
in which he had different identities.

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:21.444
It was a risk,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.868
if the audience
would understand it or not.

00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:30.440
When it was shown,
people didn’t understand.

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:37.888
But I felt vindicated in a way,

00:19:37.912 --> 00:19:44.050
because the one person
who understood it was a woman,

00:19:44.081 --> 00:19:47.727
who isn't a member of the LGBT.

00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:55.894
This is one example

00:19:55.961 --> 00:20:01.370
in choosing a structure
or choosing a scenario.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:04.696
Changing partners is a device –

00:20:05.117 --> 00:20:06.884
a structuring device.

00:20:09.311 --> 00:20:11.172
When you watch the play,

00:20:11.554 --> 00:20:15.949
the characters change
but the story's still the same.

00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:21.199
A story may be very conventional

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:26.925
like a story of lovers
who break up

00:20:27.168 --> 00:20:29.486
except when they change the characters

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.750
as though they were different
but are actually the same.

00:20:34.723 --> 00:20:41.292
That’s what I’m talking about,
That’s the mark of the writer.

00:20:41.711 --> 00:20:43.231
That’s what makes it different,

00:20:43.256 --> 00:20:47.150
That’s what makes it unique,
that’s what makes it yours.

00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:50.074
That’s your biggest input

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:53.968
about the theme
because themes are very generic.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.654
Love,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.474
justice, freedom.

00:20:57.542 --> 00:21:01.665
A play could have
just one scene

00:21:02.738 --> 00:21:03.891
for two hours.

00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:07.395
It’s possible, right?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.559
Or there could be a lot of scenes,

00:21:14.343 --> 00:21:16.679
especially now, with the

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:23.385
modern way of having simultaneous
scenes or split scnes split scenes

00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:27.664
that they could’ve
gotten from cinema.

00:21:29.027 --> 00:21:32.891
That wasn’t a thing back then.

00:21:32.996 --> 00:21:42.735
So there’s a lot of devices now,
 possibly originating  from films.

00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:45.114
An example is the flashback.

00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:52.150
Before cinema,
I don't know any play

00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:55.129
that used flashbacks.

00:21:56.309 --> 00:21:59.304
The past always used to be narrated,

00:22:01.598 --> 00:22:05.810
but because of flashbacks,
Arthur Miller was able to create

00:22:05.953 --> 00:22:08.306
“The Death of the Salesman.”

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.691
I could be wrong,
but it’s kind of like that.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.634
Other cinematic devices
carried over like that in theater.
