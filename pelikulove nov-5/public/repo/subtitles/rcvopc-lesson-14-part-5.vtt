00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.849
Let's talk about the actors.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:20.716
For the playwrights,
it was common before

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:26.627
where the actors end up saying
something else instead of their lines.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.600
What's your take on that?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.065
You go first.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.993
It's fine with me as long as
the story doesn't change.

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:41.029
But...

00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:45.121
As long as it's still
the same character.

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:48.757
'Cause you shape the language
in order to build the character.

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:54.060
But it reaches the point
where the actor inserts lines...

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.771
The playwright can't do much anyway
even if it's not working out

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:01.766
when the actor's on stage
nothing can be done.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:02.703
You can't say stop.

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.160
They usually do ad libs, right?

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:06.768
How about you?

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.274
Maybe when the point gets clouded.

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:13.823
Because every line has an objective.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.235
So if she adds something
that clouds the main point, even a chunk--

00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:24.545
It's okay to do ad libs
in order to make it more entertaining.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:28.233
- But if it clouds the point--
- The actor gets carried away.

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:32.980
Yeah, or if she deviates
from her character

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.637
because she wants
to show off or whatever.

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:40.653
But if they forget the lines,
I understand that kind of thing.

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:43.126
My concern is just when
the main point gets clouded.

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:47.751
But I don't have issues
on changing or rephrasing the text

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:52.128
as long as it comes out naturally
and it works for the actor.

00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:56.526
I have lines where
it's the thought that counts

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.990
so it's okay for it to change.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:02.913
But there are lines for later scenes
the actor might've overlooked,

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.660
on the same context,

00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:07.172
or if it's a punchline
that she didn't understand.

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:09.740
So there are some...

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.162
Non-negotiables.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.543
There are non-negotiables
you need to clearly tell actors about

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.518
and explain the lines
and its references.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:21.916
I think that's an enriching experience
for actors and directors,

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:24.398
at least from my perspective.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.883
Even if you don't change the line,
there are three beats and units you could do.

00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:31.563
Like, “I love you.”

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:34.737
It's possible to do
and the meaning can change.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:39.159
Those are the tools
that actors and directors play with,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.880
so the word doesn't have to be changed
because the beat could change mid-word.

00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.601
That happens sometimes.

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:50.965
That's what's exciting to do.

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:57.371
Personally, I also have so much respect for,
I guess, for the written word in general,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.859
so even if Herbie prohibited ad libbing,
I wouldn't ad lib on my life.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.900
We all have our roles.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.162
Director, writer, actor.

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:15.688
I will not rewrite
what you put down.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.696
It's unbelievable,

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:20.863
although some actors are given...

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.108
- Free reign to ad lib.
- Free reign.

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:26.759
As long as it's within context
of the character.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.183
For me, I think not doing an ad lib
is deeply ingrained in me.

00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:34.121
Unless there's really no...

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.357
Unless your co-actor forgot.

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.210
Things like that.

00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:40.716
Or they were absent.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.382
- Or someone skipped lines.
- You have to continue ad libbing.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:47.649
It also feels good as an actor

00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:51.759
when you're able to make
the lines feel organic.

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:54.354
When you watch it,
even me as an audience,

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.507
When the words feel like
it actually came from the actor,

00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.453
it's amazing how actors
can deliver the lines organically.

00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:03.622
That's also interesting to watch.

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:04.989
Sometimes actors complain

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:07.232
about "unnatural” parts,
but they'll act it out and then--

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:08.740
It's just right.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.583
It seems unnatural
but when they act it out,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.092
it all comes together.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:20.370
I also like it
when an actor has this role

00:04:20.513 --> 00:04:26.560
and she acts it out even if she disagrees
with the character's thought process.

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:28.324
And then years later,
you see each other again

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:33.463
your perspective seems right
and she now understands the character.

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:36.982
Sometimes, characters don't share
the same psyche as we artists do.

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:38.159
- Yes.

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:39.807
That's also what
we look out for in actors

00:04:39.832 --> 00:04:42.036
because they tend to disagree
how the character should be.

00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:43.551
That's your judgment.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.164
That's your truth,
your educational background

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:48.360
so you have to move away
from that point of view.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.072
I also think that if you’re an actor
you should be neutral,

00:04:51.128 --> 00:04:56.539
I think you should breathe life
into whatever role's given to you.

00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:01.347
Not that you’re not thinking about it,
but sometimes I really feel like some actors

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.315
especially the more senior ones
or not even the seniors,

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:09.988
I don’t know if they’re practicing
their need to express themselves

00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:14.122
but they're questioning it beyond
what they should be questioning as actors

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:17.798
and I find it rather unfair
whether to the writer or to the director,

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.919
Do you have anything else
you want to say?

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:26.880
For me, today it made me think
as a playwright not as a director.

00:05:28.623 --> 00:05:35.618
Although I trained as a director,
I found a voice in playwriting early on.

00:05:36.373 --> 00:05:40.224
It made me wonder quite recently
because I haven’t really written anything,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.271
I’ve been directing more
these past years more than writing.

00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:45.899
It surprised me,

00:05:46.158 --> 00:05:48.047
why there's a sudden interest

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.740
on a work I’ve done
so many years ago.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:56.292
I’m referring to "Buwan at Baril",

00:05:56.317 --> 00:05:58.499
in fact, when it was brought up
for re-production,

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:04.068
I was like, “Why? It's so ancient,”
When I read it, it's so...

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:05.393
Dated.

00:06:05.773 --> 00:06:10.155
I was actually very seriously concerned
if it was gonna work.

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.120
Even when you called me,
I don’t think this will work today, no?

00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:17.033
But then again, of course

00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:19.870
to my pleasant surprise,
it worked well.

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.984
and I thought that
the readings in the present

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:23.174
give it an amazing--

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.831
You also did the version of it.

00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:26.385
I said, why?

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.119
And then I realized that

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.399
It was the world
that I was so familiar with

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:37.579
and you begin writing from that place

00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:40.063
and trust that world

00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:44.124
and see what
that kind of world opens to you.

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:45.058
And I think

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:46.997
many truths--

00:06:48.472 --> 00:06:51.414
that point where you're most truthful

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:52.903
because you know
that world so well

00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:55.622
and we want to write
about that truth

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.495
I guess that would tide
you over through the years

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.358
and in a way,
I think that is the characteristic of the piece.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.719
That's why it withstood time

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:09.335
because you started
from a place of truth.

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:12.966
I'm going to respond to "Buwan at Baril"

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:16.364
because I feel like what we're
looking for in a piece

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:20.855
are the materials
that are timely and timeless.

00:07:20.924 --> 00:07:22.827
These two things.

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.304
and that was the "Buwan at Baril" for us.

00:07:25.334 --> 00:07:27.238
- Of course when you are writing that you don't

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.673
- Yes, you don't know that

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:32.011
- For me, it is very time bound

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:43.770
Write about something new.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.683
It has  to be something really...

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.880
you have passion for,
you know you feel for

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:56.819
because that's where things emerge--
especially in the early years

00:07:57.115 --> 00:07:59.771
so that you can practice
within the realm that you know.

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:03.900
Sometimes, I have a problem
when I read some of the plays.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.916
The writer doesn't seem
to know what she's doing

00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:13.404
because it doesn't feel like
it's grounded to the truth.

00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:17.349
So when you say, "write about something"
that’s so grounded in...

00:08:17.506 --> 00:08:19.572
I think that’s really important

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:21.997
when I read the script,
that I don't feel that.

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:26.504
I don’t like the writers just
imagining stuff for the heck of it

00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:28.130
or feeling like
she can just imagine things.

00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:30.005
You can tell, right?

00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:32.505
There are scripts
that just have that ground.

00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:34.371
Plus that kind of integrity.

00:08:34.654 --> 00:08:36.099
That's what I'm looking for.

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:38.229
And again it doesn’t
have to be perfect

00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:41.587
but you know in its core,
there's a seed planted.

00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:44.406
Write something new and feel for it.

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:50.755
For writers, you should
expand your experiences in different areas.

00:08:51.094 --> 00:08:56.536
So you get to write this one,
and it’s going to be grounded with truth.

00:08:58.182 --> 00:09:03.218
I think that qualifies
Kazuo Ishiguro's stand

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:07.319
that you don’t have to write
from your personal experience

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.812
But you really to have to write
about something that you know.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:16.500
And if you don't know,
you have to do some extensive research

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:19.937
until it's almost palpable to you.
