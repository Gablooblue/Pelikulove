00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.855
You’ve written
the topic you chose,

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:19.853
but you can’t deliver
the story just yet.

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:24.911
If you noticed
with all the exercises I gave you,

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:31.671
you’re forced
to choose a character.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.808
A character that will move
the story forward.

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:40.462
Since the narrator can’t be
the only one telling the story.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.988
Even plays that have a narrator,

00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:48.605
they need characters

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:53.507
who’ll make the story come to life,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.240
who’ll reveal the story you want,
not just simply narrate it.

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:01.828
For monologues,

00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:02.921
it's fine.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.050
because its just one
person saying it,

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:10.103
but that’s a different thing.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.485
Even the monologue
of your chosen character

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.303
can reveal other characters.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.616
She can talk about other
characters in her story.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:25.943
And oftentimes,

00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.212
she can put himself
into their perspective.

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:34.721
Whatever happens,
you need at least one character

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:37.442
to push the story forward.

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:40.834
That’s what we call the character.

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:51.918
In my many years
of experience as a playwright,

00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:59.459
I was also told to make three-dimensional
characters as a beginning writer.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.671
I also reached that point

00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:06.303
where I attempted
to write character biographies.

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:10.513
From their birth to their childhood,
who their parents are,

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:14.573
where they live,
how their neighbors see them,

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.436
where they studied,
what language they speak,

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.676
what their IQ is,
their bood type.

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:23.701
Does she have a mole?
Does she have a birthmark?

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:26.270
Does she have an illness?
Asthma?

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.135
And so on.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.620
We go through it one by one.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.132
There are physical,

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.749
sociological,

00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:36.558
and psychological aspects.

00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:38.626
And the combination of all those

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:42.988
form a three-dimensional
character.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:44.881
You could do that,

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:57.090
But I think this exercise
will only help a little.

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.174
Why?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.803
Because there’s a huge difference
between a real 3D human being and a character.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:15.513
A character isn’t an actual person.
That’s why it’s called character.

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.844
In reality,
humans want a lot of things.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.379
We want good food.
We want to be a doctor.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.348
We want our mom to love us.

00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:34.943
We want to be famous on television.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.660
We want lots of people
to know us through Facebook

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:42.112
We want a lot of likes
on our posts.

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.127
And so on.

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:44.550
We want a lot of things

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:49.017
and various stories can stem
from all these desires.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:52.576
That's why a person
can be full of experiences.

00:03:52.601 --> 00:04:01.205
But at the same time
you can't have one definition for a person.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.493
You could sum up her life,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.853
and she could have traits that stand out
to introduce her character,

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:17.167
but that's not the real person.

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:27.906
When we write a play,
the character usually wants one thing.

00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:36.806
The reason for that
is because you only have one story

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.508
Especially when we talk
about the protagonist.

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:49.306
She wants something to happen,
she wants to achieve something,

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:52.553
she wants to get somewhere.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:05:02.801
the the biggest thing
we're waiting for to be answered is

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:05.560
"Will she get it or not?"

00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:10.875
What the character wants
could also be unclear to him,

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:17.152
but it's important
for the writer to know.

00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:23.937
In essence, what differentiates
a character from a real person

00:05:24.104 --> 00:05:26.883
is the singularity of the objective.

00:05:27.384 --> 00:05:31.819
In order to finish the story,
the character only wants one thing.

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:42.811
Whatever traits the character has
could help in attaining her objective

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.336
or be an obstacle.

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.328
If she wants to win the olympics,
she could get sprained

00:05:51.825 --> 00:05:54.658
or contract a severe disease

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.679
that would lead to
her foot being amputated.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.804
We probaby don't need
to know her hair color

00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:15.532
because that doesn't help
in the character's development.

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:19.046
You coud use other traits
of the character

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.893
that could add texture
to her personality

00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:30.708
so that it doesn't feel
like she only has one trait.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:33.572
But that's just

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:37.486
supplementary.

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:47.591
It's not important what
other traits you added.

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:53.951
But for me, whatever traits
you give your character,

00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:59.959
whatever traits you add
to the character you nurtured

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:09.722
should eventually become important
in the story she's going through.

00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.095
You might say,

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:18.612
if it's like that, then "It's not 3D,"

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.087
What I'm saying is

00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:24.688
it's possible that you don't

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:30.432
entirely know
the character that well,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.182
where you include traits
that's not part of the story.

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.426
You can't put everything in.

00:07:37.092 --> 00:07:40.217
Remember, the longest you
have is an hour and a half.

00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:45.349
Or three hours
if you want it to be that long.

00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:47.969
For example, Jesus’ life.

00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.931
You can’t show

00:07:51.048 --> 00:07:54.672
the entirety of his life
just to see his personality.

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:59.685
His long life story
has only one desire:

00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:03.084
the salvation of humanity.

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.245
Just that.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:10.726
And when he dies on the cross
and resurrects to heaven,

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:12.074
that's when the story ends

00:08:12.132 --> 00:08:16.156
because he already achieved
his desire as a character.

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.963
We, as real human beings,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.772
when we achieve our goals
for the day we become happy.

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:27.938
We'll celebrate because we graduated.

00:08:27.997 --> 00:08:31.933
We'll celebrate because we got married
and we got what we want.

00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:34.622
It’s finally the happiest
moment of our lives.

00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:36.647
But there's still tomorrow,

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.306
and that never ends until we die.

00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.068
Characters aren't like that.

00:08:44.394 --> 00:08:48.113
She only finishes the story
you chose for him.

00:08:50.387 --> 00:08:54.024
But that doesn't mean
she's not three-dimensional.

00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:57.590
It just means she's going through
it in one direction.

00:08:57.768 --> 00:09:00.443
Directional, not dimensional.

00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:03.627
Because in that direction

00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:09.878
is where her traits will unfold
which will seem like 3D.

00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:17.530
We're just creating the illusion
that this character is a real person,

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:23.305
especially if the style
you chose is realism.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.481
It's difficult to make
a character biography

00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:30.413
if your character is a rabbit,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.820
especially if its a children's story.

00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:40.198
The most important thing

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.821
in choosing
your character's characteristics

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:47.649
is what specific traits
you're going to give him

00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:53.312
in order to help or obstruct
the story she'll go through

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.207
the situation she'll go through

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.453
which you chose yourself

00:09:58.254 --> 00:10:01.691
just to see how she'll react.

00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:03.732
That's based on the fact that

00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:07.573
different characters
will have different ways of reacting.

00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:09.562
For example,
in an earthquake,

00:10:10.403 --> 00:10:15.192
if your character is brave,
he probably won't faint from fear.

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:20.531
In choosing
the character's traits,

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:27.307
it will also depend on the situation
you'll put him in or give to him,

00:10:27.425 --> 00:10:29.972
and making sure that
the characteristics and situation

00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:38.000
is what will form or clarify,
reveal or unfold the story

00:10:38.058 --> 00:10:41.643
until you reach
the climax and resolution.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:47.938
Whatever dimension
of that character

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:53.942
that's irrelevant in the general
direction of the story,

00:10:55.223 --> 00:10:57.331
you might have to remove.

00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:00.086
And if you do remove it,

00:11:00.184 --> 00:11:02.027
why did you have to put it?

00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:09.215
So what am I getting at?

00:11:10.028 --> 00:11:15.041
I'm not saying you should just bring her
to where she wants to go.

00:11:15.099 --> 00:11:16.955
Of course, you can expand that.

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:21.052
Later, when we create the conflict,

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:29.408
we'll see that most of the conflicts
that a character faces

00:11:29.486 --> 00:11:34.619
are conflicts against
her other identities

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:41.877
For example, in May's scene earlier,

00:11:41.955 --> 00:11:44.171
"Should a woman become a mother?"

00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.877
Those are two identities right there.

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:50.931
The woman as a woman,
probably with a career,

00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:53.450
versus the woman as a mother.

00:11:54.154 --> 00:11:58.042
We see a character
who has to wear high heels

00:11:58.097 --> 00:12:04.087
and refuses to bear a child
and would prefer to wear high heels

00:12:04.126 --> 00:12:07.829
because her identity
as a career woman

00:12:07.907 --> 00:12:12.185
is clashing with her identity
as being a mother.

00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:17.867
That's when the character's
two identities become relevant.

00:12:18.273 --> 00:12:23.292
It really depends on where
you’re taking the whole thing.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.327
At the same time, like what I said,
it’s not one after another,

00:12:27.405 --> 00:12:29.062
you connect the two

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.236
like Lego.

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:33.836
The situation where
you’ll put the character

00:12:33.895 --> 00:12:37.520
and how the character
will react to it.
