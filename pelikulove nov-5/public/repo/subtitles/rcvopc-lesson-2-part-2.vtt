00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.757
Let’s see how well
you refute yourselves.

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.694
"It isn't so much
a matter of gender roles."

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.123
"It's a matter of biology."

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:26.123
"The female body was created
for the purpose of child-bearing."

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:29.327
"So at the anatomical level,
it's the female's duty to bear children."

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:31.647
"It's only the ideologies
surrounding gender"

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:34.014
"that seems to present
this ability in a negative light."

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.119
"It's also this ideology
that makes this ability a disability."

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:41.523
"It makes it seem that a woman
who becomes a mother cannot be anything else."

00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:43.689
"Many women choose
not to become mothers"

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:45.637
"because it seems to be
something that stands in the way."

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:47.006
"Motherhood"
[inaudible]

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:50.027
"Motherhood causes women
to 'miss' other opportunities."

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:53.703
"That they could've become so much more
had they not chosen to become mothers."

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.401
Sir, I wasn't able to finish.

00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:59.021
What's the verdict?

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:01.780
- You should be a mother.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.578
Yes, mother.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:07.641
Okay, next.
Dingdong.

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:10.469
"All people grieve the same way."

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:11.474
"You see it in the news."

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:12.723
"When someone grieves,
someone cries."

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:14.338
"Even animals cry for their young."

00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:19.291
"Perhaps what one perceives as not
being able to totally accept someone's loss"

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.945
"is a reflection of having
finished grieving."

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.587
"That someone
has processed it quite quickly,"

00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:27.258
"having gone through
denial to acceptance so fast,"

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:28.970
"that all that's left are memories."

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:32.045
"We may be more than memories,
but just what ifs in life."

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.285
"What if that person were still around?
Where would we be?"

00:01:35.543 --> 00:01:38.683
"And in fact you're no longer
grieving over someone's loss"

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.791
"but just missing moments
in your life that you were with someone."

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:45.008
"That it doesn't even matter
who that particular someone is."

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.453
"And if you find someone else
to fill that gap,"

00:01:47.493 --> 00:01:49.698
"then you create
new memories to move on."

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:55.423
- I know who that is.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.052
I understand.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.095
Alright, next.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.265
"I don't believe in polyamory."

00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:07.938
"Especially in gay relationships."

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.048
"I don't believe in it
because a lifetime is not enough"

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.756
"to get to know a person."

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:16.877
"The suffering and the sacrifice
is part of love."

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:19.497
"When someone catches your eye
or you lust for someone,"

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:22.085
"and you decide
to act on these feelings,"

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.965
"then maybe it's time to go back
to why you're still in that relationship."

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:31.306
"Cutting ties is not
the end of a relationship."

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:34.729
"It could just be going through
a metamorphosis."

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.249
"I don't believe in polyamory,
especially among gays"

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.997
"because there are many
reservoirs for love to go to"

00:02:42.137 --> 00:02:43.818
"beyond this system."

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.939
Did you find it difficult?

00:02:47.964 --> 00:02:50.177
- It's difficult because it's contradictory--

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.835
To what you really feel?

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.693
It makes you believe
the opposing stance.

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:59.284
But how did you
find arguments like that?

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:07.818
It’s a matter of looking at the same object
from a different perspective.

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:15.467
Maybe you also need to borrow
the perspectives of others

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:21.942
whose views are completely
different from your own.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.327
So you’re also compelled
to understand the other side

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:28.906
without necessarily

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:32.724
agreeing to that.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:38.181
This is one
of my favorite exercises

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.820
because you first get
to see the person’s belief

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:45.888
and what it's about.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.535
It may be personal to you,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.835
or it's made an impact on a mental
or intellectual level,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.257
or even to the gut level,

00:03:56.282 --> 00:04:01.378
that this is really what you believe in
and what it takes to take the other side.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:07.314
This is where
you break your comfort zone,

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:09.833
and your confidence
in your beliefs.

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:17.884
It makes you understand
that you’re not the only one

00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:20.254
living in this world.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.791
It's always like that.

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:24.948
We live in a very
dichotomous world.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:34.920
There's always someone
who'll oppose your stance,

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:40.923
which later on we will realize

00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:47.618
is the core essence of drama.

00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:53.589
This is now the third step.

00:04:53.614 --> 00:04:57.473
But before we go to the third step,
read your work first.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:00.395
Did your opposing stance
convince you?

00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:02.416
You made that yourself.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.272
If you noticed,

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:10.978
if you followed my instructions,

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:13.581
put your exercises
side by side.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:16.613
Compare the two arguments.

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:21.679
You might get convinced
by the second argument.

00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:25.736
What's the point of this exercise?

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:29.033
You don't just rely
on your opinion.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.331
As a writer, this is one
of the processes where

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:43.164
when you don't really have a grasp
on the material you chose,

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:46.313
then it’s important to investigate

00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:56.574
all sides of the topic,

00:05:56.962 --> 00:05:59.783
the story or the character.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.937
I just want to point out

00:06:07.047 --> 00:06:09.530
that in choosing
a writing material,

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:12.497
you may also choose a
character as your topic.

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:16.174
Say you got fascinated

00:06:16.283 --> 00:06:17.727
by your neighbor

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.623
who sells sausages

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:22.281
and because of that

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.463
you started researching
about her life,

00:06:25.488 --> 00:06:27.783
what she’s doing and
why she’s doing it,

00:06:27.823 --> 00:06:30.304
until you eventually
form a story out of it.

00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:33.756
But what’s important
is what you see in it

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:37.228
that's strong enough
to turn the story into a play.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:38.960
So now,

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:40.670
you have

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.237
a strong standpoint

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:51.783
on why you should tell this story

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:52.960
and you have

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.791
opposing arguments

00:06:58.135 --> 00:07:01.329
against the initial topic.

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:03.865
Let's go to the third step.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.277
I want you to make

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:10.010
some kind of monologue
where there will be two of you.

00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:14.901
It's still you, but there are two
aspects of you talking to each other.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.745
And through this dialogue,

00:07:20.683 --> 00:07:28.061
these two sides of you will debate.

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:32.163
And then see
for yourself who'll win.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.843
Don’t get ahead of yourself

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.583
just because you believe
the other stand.

00:07:38.768 --> 00:07:40.788
I’ll respect your belief.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:42.007
But don't get ahead of yourself.

00:07:42.032 --> 00:07:47.468
Just observe where
this "scene" will lead to,

00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:55.276
where two sides of yourself
are debating on the topic you chose.

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.829
Use the first and second arguments.

00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:07.097
Don't write a prose,
but more of a conversation

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:11.408
or an argument on the topic you chose.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.412
It won’t look like
two separate manifestos.

00:08:16.602 --> 00:08:22.132
Put them in one 'scene',
but with only one person talking.

00:08:22.157 --> 00:08:24.223
And that character is you.

00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:27.663
You need to organize
your thoughts in a such a way

00:08:27.922 --> 00:08:29.820
that will look like

00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:34.913
you're debating with yourself.

00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:36.569
Did you get it?

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:37.815
Alright.

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.737
- "Should a woman become a mother?"

00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:47.438
"'Should'? Isn't that a little sexist?"

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.856
"Why is it only women
that 'should' have children?"

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:53.192
"Why don't we expect
the same from men?"

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:55.577
"We don't judge men when
they choose to not settle down"

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.294
"so why do we judge women?"

00:08:57.368 --> 00:09:00.664
"Then again, it is only women
who can bear children."

00:09:00.843 --> 00:09:02.640
"It's hardwired in our biology."

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:04.993
"Our bodies are designed
to bear children."

00:09:05.095 --> 00:09:07.317
"Maybe this is where
that sense of duty comes from."

00:09:07.342 --> 00:09:10.222
"It's a must for women,
anatomically speaking."

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:15.002
"It's only the ideology surrounding
womanhood that makes it seem negative."

00:09:15.073 --> 00:09:17.792
"We've been taught to think,
and wrongfully so,"

00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:19.730
"that motherhood is a disability"

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:22.185
"that hinders us from
becoming anyone else."

00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:25.123
"And I know women who are mothers
and who have achieved so much."

00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:27.790
"So maybe if we do away with
these negative perceptions,"

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:30.065
"we won't see motherhood
this negatively."

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:33.368
"But can we ever truly live in a world
where we don't think this way?"

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.042
"Old habits die hard"

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:37.479
"and it is difficult to just
simply do away with these thoughts"

00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:39.235
"and expectations and roles."

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:41.789
"It takes work to stop
thinking in these terms."

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:45.434
"But who started this negative
perspective on motherhood anyway?"

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:47.265
"The patriarchy?"

00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:48.784
"The so-called feminists?"

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.863
"Men?"

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:50.514
"Women?"

00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:51.415
"Both?"

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:52.992
"Should it matter?"

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:57.298
"Does my identity as a woman really rest
on my choice to have children or not?"

00:09:57.558 --> 00:10:00.829
"Shouldn't it have no bearing
on who I am and how I see myself?"

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:04.881
"Aren't I a woman whether or not
I choose to fulfill my biological role?"

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.424
"Sure, people might tell me
that I'm still too young."

00:10:07.449 --> 00:10:08.520
"That I will change my mind."

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:11.670
"And that I will never be fulfilled
as a woman if I have no children."

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.611
"But why should I listen to them?"

00:10:13.777 --> 00:10:17.142
"I'm not saying I won't have children.
I'm also not saying that I will."

00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:18.644
"I'm not sure yet."

00:10:18.753 --> 00:10:21.230
"But when the time comes,
I will decide."

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:25.580
She's really fired up.

00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:28.938
Next.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.776
"You didn't cry during the funeral,
but you cried when you came home"

00:10:32.801 --> 00:10:36.313
"from the hospital.
When you were finally alone."

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.826
"They say grieving
is different for everyone"

00:10:38.857 --> 00:10:40.547
"so for a few months
there's sadness."

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.881
"Sometimes you still talk to him
even though you're alone."

00:10:43.932 --> 00:10:45.826
"You want him to visit you
to feel his presence."

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.198
"You look at old pictures
to remember his smile,"

00:10:48.223 --> 00:10:49.633
"the places you went to,"

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.923
"the things you did,"

00:10:50.948 --> 00:10:53.888
"until such time you can
look at old photos"

00:10:53.913 --> 00:10:56.245
"and miss him a little less."

00:10:56.277 --> 00:10:58.984
"You'll never forget him,
that's for sure."

00:10:59.112 --> 00:11:03.749
"But after one year,
you don't look at the photos as much."

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.086
"He just lives in the
stories of your friends."

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.359
"The way he talks and acts."

00:11:09.663 --> 00:11:11.083
"But you still love him."

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.061
"Or maybe you just loved him
when you were always together."

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:17.619
"The way you love someone
when you spend a lot of time together."

00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:20.202
"But when spending
time together stops,"

00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:22.552
"if he's a story seldom told,
has the love gone?"

00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:24.679
"Sometimes the details fade."

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:27.122
"Did we visit this place?
Was this what I wore?"

00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:28.624
"Was I happy that time?"

00:11:28.732 --> 00:11:30.604
"Then you meet someone else"

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.441
"whom you get to
spend a lot of time"

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:35.479
"making new memories with."

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:38.317
"You still love what you had,
but you've moved on."

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.749
"You still remember some things,
but your pain finally ended."

00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:46.098
Seems like the latter won?

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:56.883
- Moving on.

00:11:58.063 --> 00:12:00.935
So we are witness
to a conversion.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.537
- Yeah.

00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:04.650
- When you think
of a counterthesis, it's like that.

00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:07.004
Alright. Next.

00:12:08.586 --> 00:12:10.199
- "Motherfucker.
He said he loves me."

00:12:10.224 --> 00:12:11.783
"That I'm his favorite dish."

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.638
"That he doesn't get tired
of eating me daily,"

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.061
"for lunch and dinner..."

00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:17.272
"Even for snacks,
he'd still choose his favorite dish."

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.045
"He says I'm like his cigarette."

00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:20.783
"Delicious but deadly."

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:22.432
"But then that soured."

00:12:22.862 --> 00:12:23.886
"He got scared."

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.969
"Discovered a new dish.
Got addicted to a new vice."

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:27.956
"Suddenly,"

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.837
"he wants you all in one table."

00:12:31.142 --> 00:12:33.326
"They say addiction is best savored"

00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:35.592
"when you experience
dying with others."

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.961
"I didn't want to stay anymore."

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.240
"But what am I going to do?"

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:39.031
"How should it be?"

00:12:39.336 --> 00:12:41.931
"I tasted another,
looked for fun elsewhere."

00:12:42.148 --> 00:12:43.594
"But after everything else,"

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.609
"his image fills my mind."

00:12:45.844 --> 00:12:48.346
"I can still distinctly taste
his flavor against others."

00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:51.145
"It strongly clings to my breath.
Motherfucker."

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:53.228
- Motherfucker.

00:12:57.183 --> 00:12:59.993
Infidelity.
Is it right or wrong?

00:13:07.848 --> 00:13:10.020
The truth is you've already
created a scene

00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:12.164
in step three.

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:15.189
But the scene you've made,

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:22.358
shows what's on your mind

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.682
as a writer.

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:25.749
For step four,

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:28.548
let's try opening this up.

00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:34.729
Exclude yourselves
from the scene you'll write.

00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:38.495
Use the same topic,

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:42.713
but add two characters

00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:44.823
that you think

00:13:45.573 --> 00:13:51.781
will naturally talk about
the topic you chose.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:58.684
You get to choose
where the scene happens.

00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:03.511
I'll just add one requirement.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.774
Include one item or object.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.797
It can be a ball,
handkerchief, whatever,

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:25.219
that the characters
will move around in.

00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:27.827
But don't let go of that object.

00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:31.777
Or make sure the characters
will talk about that object.

00:14:32.522 --> 00:14:37.079
In using this certain object,
either visible or not,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.913
in negotiating that object,

00:14:41.652 --> 00:14:43.655
the topic you chose
should emerge.

00:14:43.908 --> 00:14:45.352
- How about a living thing?

00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:48.766
You mean a pet, a dog,
something like that?

00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:50.956
- A child?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.204
It's possible

00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:57.764
as long as you're not
directly talking to the child.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.860
I imagine a sick child, for example.

00:15:02.885 --> 00:15:06.069
That's possible, too.

00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:09.641
Maybe a pregnancy kit.

00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:11.955
Or...?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.366
A death certificate.

00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:19.502
Ashes. Urn.

00:15:20.692 --> 00:15:25.043
But you can go, you can do even--

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.726
I'd appreciate it more if it's something

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.895
that doesn't seem connected

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.112
but will make sense later on.

00:15:34.304 --> 00:15:38.465
Just one scene
where the object appears

00:15:38.597 --> 00:15:42.097
and where your arguments emerge,

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:47.439
without necessarily going verbatim

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:49.946
or taking off using those lines.

00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:54.426
Because those lines
are you talking.

00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:55.936
Now this time,

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:59.400
take two characters
that are not you

00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:03.657
but have the same dilemma.

00:16:04.113 --> 00:16:05.589
- Only one object?

00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:07.870
Just one first.

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.439
- Do you want more?
- No, not really.

00:16:11.464 --> 00:16:13.035
- But what if something new shows up?

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:14.861
That's fine, too.

00:16:16.116 --> 00:16:18.843
It's okay.
A set of objects, if you want.

00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:20.897
A list.

00:16:23.052 --> 00:16:25.397
I'm really only giving you five minutes.

00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:26.792
- That's harder.

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:30.188
When I finish this game,

00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:32.195
your time's up.
