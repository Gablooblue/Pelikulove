00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.656
143444      At the count of three

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.317
143444      you will eventually fall asleep

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:40.652
143444      One...

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:43.508
143444      two...

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:46.194
143444      three.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.466
143444      Hi.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.681
143444      Dad?

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:03.533
143444      Let's stay like this.

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:04.993
143444      Why--?

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:06.765
143444      Let's just stay like this, please.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:07.947
143444      Just for a bit.

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:09.316
143444      Let's stay like this.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.057
143444      Wait.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:11.910
143444      Just for a bit!

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:42.681
143444      Dad?

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.126
143444      Can I ask something now?

00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:49.330
143444      Go ahead.

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.417
143444      What...?

00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:58.332
143444      Where...?

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:03.605
143444      When did you die?

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.367
Two years ago.

00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:09.075
H-How?

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:12.530
Would you believe,

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:14.358
TV.

00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:16.305
Tuberculosis?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.414
Stupid, TV.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.598
The TV fell down on me.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:19.456
For real?

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:20.261
For real.

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:21.330
On my foot.

00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:22.963
The wound was so bad.

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.525
It was costly going back
and forth to the hospital that's why

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.117
I decided to treat
the wound myself,

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:28.184
but it became infected.

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:29.582
I got poisoned.

00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:31.687
It was stinky and disgusting.

00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:33.606
Can you check if it still smells?

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.627
I believe you!

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:38.256
Your feet have always been
stinky and disgusting.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.292
Wow!

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.024
As if your feet are pretty.

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:41.929
Thank you.

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:44.981
That's what I inherited from you
and you're making fun of it.

00:02:45.257 --> 00:02:46.464
Inherit?

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.261
You didn't inherit your feet.

00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:51.766
Our feet are entwined,

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.076
Just like our souls.

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:58.986
What did he say?

00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:02.236
Alright...

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:03.111
Wow...

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.809
I'll tell you a story.

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:08.217
Long ago, there were people,

00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:10.677
creatures who had two heads,

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:13.447
four arms and four feet.

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:15.245
Hey!

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:16.109
Are you listening?

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.427
Yeah! I'm listening.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.905
So those people
were creatures who had two heads

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.715
four arms and four feet.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.091
and then...

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:28.441
The gods were fearful of
their power that's why,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.818
they separated them.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:31.803
They were separated--

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:32.795
Oh my God!

00:03:33.134 --> 00:03:35.078
Look at the owl!

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:38.020
It's like a floating fire.

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:41.491
That’s the norm here,
this world defies explanation.

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.745
When you look this way,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.620
When you look this way, ma’am, sir,
you’ll find things based on your memories.

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:50.621
Over here, ma’am, sir,
are the things you might have seen before.

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:51.622
And over here, ma'am, sir,

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:54.357
is an example of something
infused with magic.

00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:55.707
If you look this way, ma’am, sir,

00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:58.232
that bird, that flaming bird.

00:03:59.214 --> 00:04:01.269
When that bird runs out of fire,

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:03.076
our time here is up.

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:04.905
So listen to me.

00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:06.778
Before our time runs out.

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:14.589
About...

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.446
About what happened back then…

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.748
You don’t have to explain.

00:04:22.787 --> 00:04:25.182
It was a long time ago
and I've forgiven you.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:27.755
Forgiveness is not important.

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:30.108
What you need to understand is...

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:31.967
why you’re here,

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:33.944
why,

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:35.538
why we’re both here.

00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:36.243
The reason why

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:37.052
we

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.190
are destined.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:40.723
Destined?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.936
What are you doing?

00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.949
Suit yourself.

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:50.770
If you don’t want to cooperate,
I'll just leave.

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:52.806
Wait, I still have a question!

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:54.489
That...

00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.557
Ah, didn’t you say you refused to go back
to the hospital because it was costly?

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:02.184
Why didn’t you ask Mom for help?

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:04.834
Your mom was sour.

00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:06.627
Ah,

00:05:06.652 --> 00:05:08.267
like a cotton fruit?

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.049
Like a tree cucumber.

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:12.352
What about me?

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.048
You could have asked me for help.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.655
I wasn’t sure if...

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:19.356
you had forgiven me.

00:05:20.047 --> 00:05:20.743
But--

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:21.644
Dad.

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.340
It was a matter of life-and-death!

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:23.904
Okay!

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:25.393
Next time.

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:29.096
Wait, I have another question!

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:31.274
About--

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:35.995
I came here for a reason.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.554
About--

00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:52.890
I still remember this.

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:54.548
It's been so long.

00:05:55.303 --> 00:05:57.803
When was the last time
I did this for you?

00:05:58.702 --> 00:06:01.009
Before Mom took me away from you.

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.635
Before she became
as bitter as a bittergourd.

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.643
Just like...

00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:07.735
Who?

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:13.577
That was a long time ago.
I was just a kid back then.

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:15.184
Why, how old are you now?

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.712
What do you think?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.499
36.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.338
Excuse me?

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:22.120
I’m just 32.

00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:25.002
36 – 24 – 36.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.927
Boom!

00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:30.955
I love this dream!

00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:32.141
What about me?

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:34.623
How do you see me?

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:35.942
Hmmm...

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:37.088
You look sturdy...

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.362
My hairline is thinning.

00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:43.045
Aren’t all the men
in your family like that?

00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:04.002
Just like a real dad.

00:07:05.953 --> 00:07:06.746
Shit.

00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:09.309
This is really wrong.

00:07:09.983 --> 00:07:12.145
In this place there are no wrongs.

00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:14.605
In this place...

00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:17.619
I am not the father you know.

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.360
Look at me closely.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.847
How old do you think I look like?

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:30.167
32?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.653
That was how my daddy looked
like when he was 32 and--

00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.612
I was eight years old.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.468
I was in Grade 3 back then.

00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:42.945
"The Owl and the Pussycat"

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:44.869
Bow.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:51.163
The owl and the pussycat
went to the sea.

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.749
In a beautiful pea green boat.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.426
They...

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.500
They...

00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:00.503
That's all I remember, and--

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:03.828
Oh lovely Pussy,
Oh Pussy my love...

00:08:04.054 --> 00:08:05.698
What a beautiful pussy you are.

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.870
All the guys I know,
that’s what they only remember, too!

00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:13.045
Because ‘what a beautiful
pussy you are’...

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:14.689
No, it’s because...

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.769
The owl is a man.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.031
And pussycat is a woman.

00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:21.314
Pussycat’s lines are mine.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.763
But owl’s lines are
what I still remember.

00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:25.862
Oh, lovely pussy.

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:27.853
Oh pussy, my love.

00:08:27.922 --> 00:08:30.384
What a beautiful pussy you are!

00:08:30.456 --> 00:08:32.322
You are!
You are!

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.193
What a beautiful pussy you are!

00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:37.267
When you were born...

00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:42.565
My gut was telling me…

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:44.585
The owl and the pussycat.

00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:47.348
Your voice was an angel’s.

00:08:47.373 --> 00:08:48.716
Went to the sea.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.910
In a beautiful pea green boat.

00:08:52.468 --> 00:08:54.333
Your embrace, a blue sky.

00:08:54.358 --> 00:08:55.037
They...

00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:58.336
They...

00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:05.843
They were quiet.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:11.484
As I continuously repeated the line,
"The owl and the pussycat."

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.539
They were just staring at me.

00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:18.047
I'm sorry.

00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:22.736
If I could only take
all the pain and hurt, I would.

00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:30.876
You let me face the crowd
with mom as my only companion.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.526
But, at that moment...

00:09:34.443 --> 00:09:35.813
You were the one I needed.

00:09:36.023 --> 00:09:37.430
I understand.

00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:39.472
You're all I need, too.

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:43.723
When you were born I knew
there's a different bond between us.

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.278
But I ignored that.

00:09:49.314 --> 00:09:51.812
I ignored what I felt and--

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:55.607
Worked just like a good father.

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:58.359
Until I realized--

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:00.278
Isn't that wrong, because--

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:02.976
because that's the opposite
of what I really felt.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.838
Let's stay like this.

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:09.473
Just for a bit.

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.179
Let's stay like this. Please.

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:12.387
Please.

00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:13.659
Let's stay like this--

00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:14.131
No!

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.474
Please--

00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:44.986
I caught up, right?

00:10:46.087 --> 00:10:47.011
Yes!

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:51.089
And heaven’s gates suddenly opened!

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:53.564
My knight in shining armor.

00:10:53.692 --> 00:10:55.791
While I wanted to pee
in my pussycat costume,

00:10:55.816 --> 00:10:58.511
you suddenly appeared
at the far entrance of the auditorium.

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.491
The double doors opened at once.

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.344
And light came in.

00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:04.365
From there,

00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:06.726
I immediately recognized you.

00:11:07.075 --> 00:11:11.450
You headed straight towards the stage
from the center aisle then...

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:13.251
you set foot on stage,

00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:15.013
and you lifted me...

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:18.403
and you took me away
from the laughing crowd.

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:21.236
That's all I can remember.

00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:23.417
There's something else I remember.

00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:27.663
Didn't we go home and buy ice cream?

00:11:27.977 --> 00:11:30.165
There was...there weren't many

00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:34.093
flavors to choose from the bakery
at the corner of our village.

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:36.283
That’s why I ended up buying...

00:11:37.252 --> 00:11:37.872
Ube.

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:41.354
My favorite!

00:11:41.387 --> 00:11:42.152
Favorite?

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:43.686
Vanilla's your favorite.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.967
No! My favorite is ube.

00:11:44.992 --> 00:11:46.863
Didn’t you say ube’s for oldies?

00:11:47.658 --> 00:11:49.655
Maybe because…

00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:54.556
We are old souls.

00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:04.704
And then you asked me--

00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:10.122
“Dad, when you die many years later,
and I die too, will we meet in heaven?”

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:10.696
“Yes.”

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:11.367
And then?

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:13.141
We will see each other again.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.032
And then?

00:12:14.057 --> 00:12:16.818
We will live again and see each other.

00:12:16.843 --> 00:12:17.854
And then?

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.803
I didn’t know this back then.

00:12:19.828 --> 00:12:22.154
The problem is we would
have forgotten each other.

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.225
Just like...

00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:24.703
Back to zero.

00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:27.629
Back to zero?

00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:30.338
But we’ll always find each other.

00:12:30.363 --> 00:12:30.977
How?

00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:32.252
This.

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:36.024
The heart does not forget.
The heart...

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:37.392
...remembers.

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.465
But when I was 16,

00:12:42.877 --> 00:12:43.940
you left.

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.213
You forgot about me.

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.155
Yes, I left but--

00:12:49.363 --> 00:12:50.769
I didn’t forget you.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:53.964
But you never showed up again.

00:12:55.969 --> 00:12:59.179
Do you think it was easy
being away from you?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.314
I tried looking for you but--

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:06.619
Your mother took you to the province,
I dont know where.

00:13:06.938 --> 00:13:09.829
I searched for you in the White Pages,
Yellow Pages, Facebook, Google.

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:11.652
But you had so many namesakes.

00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:13.863
Did you get married?

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:14.871
No.

00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:17.548
And I don’t have a Facebook account.

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:19.562
Boyfriend.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.526
You must have had lots of boyfriends.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.216
I tried but...

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.397
My life got messed up when you left.

00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:30.134
As for me, I lived alone.

00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:35.130
I saw you once in Makati.
Turns out you were working there.

00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:39.074
I waited for you everyday, hoping that--

00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:40.428
When you passed by,

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:41.879
you’d stop and--

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.094
look at me for a second.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.565
You know what...

00:13:47.969 --> 00:13:50.137
I always dreamt of you.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.067
My heart always longed for you.

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:56.265
One day, you walked by…

00:13:59.718 --> 00:14:01.317
I got scared.

00:14:01.802 --> 00:14:03.721
I looked elsewhere.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.959
Looked elsewhere but...

00:14:07.423 --> 00:14:09.181
All I saw was you.

00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:11.060
Of course,

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:12.513
because...

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.401
you got the "eye".

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.809
And you're craving!

00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:18.269
And you had a...

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:20.433
bulge!

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:25.696
My heart beats heavily...for you.

00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:27.607
Boom!

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.303
The--

00:14:36.328 --> 00:14:38.638
The owl is slowly fading.

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:43.199
You need to know the secret
that everyone should know.

00:14:43.408 --> 00:14:44.185
Come!

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:45.918
We need to do this again and again.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.360
Where are we going?

00:14:48.385 --> 00:14:49.278
Here!

00:14:58.832 --> 00:14:59.594
Be careful.

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:16.773
Here we stand...

00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:20.876
...between the world we know and heaven.

00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:25.809
This is like a haven for kindred spirits,

00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.117
soul mates.

00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:31.650
Where separated hearts
find their way back to each other.

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:35.722
And now, I've found my other half.

00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:44.259
Thank God you're dead!

00:15:44.284 --> 00:15:45.536
Thank--

00:15:45.732 --> 00:15:48.333
Thank you!

00:15:49.764 --> 00:15:50.842
What?

00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:53.342
Wait.

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:55.860
This is turning into a nightmare!

00:15:56.775 --> 00:15:59.821
You know what, this may have
been my longest journey but...

00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:02.030
I'm glad we got to talk.

00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:04.612
- I’ll go--
- Sit down.

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:06.448
I need to tell you something.

00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:08.151
That’s not necessary because...

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:11.409
I'm going anyway,
I'll wake up in a while.

00:16:12.216 --> 00:16:14.341
Dad, I just want to tell you...

00:16:15.085 --> 00:16:16.225
You are a beast.

00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:20.094
But I've forgiven you.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.074
You cunning imp!

00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:26.225
But I love you so much.

00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:32.084
No, no.

00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:35.078
I'm just at the clinic.

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:39.183
Past life regression,
my psychologist said if I want to wake up

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.097
All I have to say...

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.353
all I have to say is...

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.956
Consummatum...

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:47.738
Est.

00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:50.329
Huh?

00:16:50.357 --> 00:16:51.085
Oh my god!

00:16:53.819 --> 00:16:54.724
Don’t you remember--

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:55.526
Oh my god!

00:16:55.846 --> 00:16:57.223
Didn't you leave the center,

00:16:57.181 --> 00:16:58.882
- then rode a car?
- Consummatum est.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:02.814
The car started moving
and then you tried to avoid but--

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:03.839
Consummatum es--

00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:08.039
There was a bright light.
You heard the breaking of glass.

00:17:08.102 --> 00:17:11.211
- You smelled the burning tire and--
- Consummatum est…

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.275
And bright light engulfed you!

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.263
Consummatum Est!

00:17:27.764 --> 00:17:29.709
It can’t be.

00:17:29.756 --> 00:17:31.270
Let’s stay here.

00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:36.001
Let's stay like this.
Just for a bit.

00:17:37.184 --> 00:17:38.639
Let's stay like this, please.

00:17:38.664 --> 00:17:39.628
Please.

00:17:39.864 --> 00:17:41.068
Let's stay like this.

00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:07.681
But this can't be...

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.752
I’ve had several sessions here.

00:18:12.652 --> 00:18:14.625
I’ve done this so many times.

00:18:14.684 --> 00:18:16.688
Tried going deep into myself.

00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:19.121
Tried finding answers.

00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:22.047
Don’t you recognize me?

00:18:22.072 --> 00:18:23.427
You're my father!

00:18:23.707 --> 00:18:25.781
Just your father?
Look at me closely!

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:27.102
Do I look like a dad to you?

00:18:27.127 --> 00:18:28.990
Yeah! A gross dad!

00:18:30.971 --> 00:18:31.787
Come here.

00:18:32.482 --> 00:18:33.545
Come with me.

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.727
Here…

00:19:10.445 --> 00:19:14.012
Here is where you'll find your soul mate.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:39.883
You know my name.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.380
Tell it to the world!

00:19:42.453 --> 00:19:43.894
They will put me to death!

00:19:43.963 --> 00:19:48.006
I have never loved and hated someone
so much at the same time!

00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:49.498
Say my name!

00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:50.419
It is…

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.081
Love!

00:20:00.738 --> 00:20:01.728
One more time!

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:14.791
Oh my love,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.938
I have waited so many years for your return.

00:20:18.963 --> 00:20:19.855
Oh!

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:22.853
My sweet little butterfly.

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:23.308
Oh!

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:26.959
We are always oceans apart.

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:28.300
But..

00:20:28.822 --> 00:20:30.794
How can we ever be together?

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:33.356
But you and I are meant to be.

00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:36.870
I have found another.

00:20:36.979 --> 00:20:39.081
But you will always be in my heart.

00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:41.564
No!

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:50.332
One more time!

00:21:08.994 --> 00:21:11.706
My father will not
give his blessing to us

00:21:11.732 --> 00:21:14.502
with all the suffering your
family has brought upon our house.

00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:17.884
The suffering will never
end until you are mine.

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:21.602
My father would rather see me
dead than have me in your arms.

00:21:21.627 --> 00:21:23.008
Then so be it.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.120
One more time!
One more time!

00:21:51.595 --> 00:21:52.472
Jack!

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:53.966
Rose.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.965
It’s freezing!

00:21:58.448 --> 00:22:00.766
Promise me you’ll never let go.

00:22:02.371 --> 00:22:03.549
I promise.

00:22:17.786 --> 00:22:19.188
Come back.

00:22:20.275 --> 00:22:21.708
Come back.

00:22:36.709 --> 00:22:37.633
Shit!

00:22:39.069 --> 00:22:41.257
That was you all this time.

00:22:41.398 --> 00:22:42.160
No.

00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:43.500
That was us.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.988
All of that was us.

00:22:56.863 --> 00:22:59.617
I was just like you
when I first arrived here.

00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:01.841
My knees got weak.

00:23:01.866 --> 00:23:04.557
Our bodies, no matter how
much we repeat it

00:23:04.582 --> 00:23:09.862
nothing can ever prepare us
for our death, our new journey.

00:23:11.553 --> 00:23:13.918
To be separated from your parents,

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.199
spouse, children...

00:23:18.267 --> 00:23:22.778
Nothing could be harder than
losing everyone all at the same time.

00:23:23.065 --> 00:23:25.965
It’s like a huge blanket of darkness...

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.892
Engulfing you.

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:39.383
Until…

00:23:40.994 --> 00:23:42.673
the world lights up.

00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.358
Everything lights up.

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:50.772
You...

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.363
and me.

00:24:16.195 --> 00:24:17.258
Hi.

00:24:18.401 --> 00:24:19.336
Hi.

00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:21.900
Do you see it now?

00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:25.959
I can finally see you.

00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:38.706
You're the reason why
I didn’t look for someone else.

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:40.672
Sometimes I thought you were the one.

00:24:41.404 --> 00:24:42.997
The world could be upside down,

00:24:43.022 --> 00:24:45.038
but I’d still look for you.

00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:47.210
So many men have come to my life.

00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:50.504
Even when I look into their eyes,
all I see are hollow cardboards.

00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:54.636
I've lived and died lots of times,
took chances on other people,

00:24:54.818 --> 00:24:57.451
hoping to find happiness but...

00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:01.127
You're the one I need.

00:25:01.408 --> 00:25:03.295
What’s important is you’re here.

00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:09.127
We can plan it again.

00:25:10.772 --> 00:25:12.415
Our next life.

00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:24.819
If we can plan our next life...

00:25:26.486 --> 00:25:29.446
Why couldn’t we be together in our past life?

00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:31.377
We couldn’t?

00:25:31.736 --> 00:25:32.395
Yes.

00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:37.873
Father and daughter turned lovers.

00:25:39.889 --> 00:25:40.673
Yes.

00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:43.024
If that was planned...

00:25:43.484 --> 00:25:45.919
why did our past life get all messed up?

00:25:47.795 --> 00:25:49.485
I don’t know.

00:25:50.072 --> 00:25:52.589
It can be planned,
but it can be forgotten.

00:25:53.688 --> 00:25:57.603
The universe will find ways
so that our paths stay on track.

00:25:57.628 --> 00:25:59.755
But we went off the track.

00:25:59.868 --> 00:26:03.252
Listen to yourself.
We're going to plan it

00:26:03.403 --> 00:26:05.755
But we're going to forget about it.

00:26:06.122 --> 00:26:07.862
That’s absurd!

00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.977
That bite on your lip
is going to throb on our first meeting.

00:26:16.329 --> 00:26:18.023
It will be easier
for you to recognize me.

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.297
If you want, you can also bite my lip!

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.852
What if…

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.466
we meet…

00:26:25.614 --> 00:26:27.646
we know each other but...

00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:29.958
we break up for some reason.

00:26:29.983 --> 00:26:32.262
Like an earthquake?

00:26:32.368 --> 00:26:34.664
Or a flood?

00:26:34.724 --> 00:26:36.658
Or a traffic jam?

00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:38.989
We’re going to fight
because of terrible traffic.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.356
And in the end...

00:26:40.524 --> 00:26:42.239
we’ll break up.

00:26:42.752 --> 00:26:43.465
You know--

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.766
I can see clearly now.

00:26:45.598 --> 00:26:47.168
It’s becoming clearer.

00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:49.982
Fate is so tough.

00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:53.448
Fate isn't tough.

00:26:53.953 --> 00:26:57.894
It's making sure you meet
your match in your lifetime.

00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.717
You meet your match but--

00:27:00.254 --> 00:27:02.490
But you find out that you’re incompatible.

00:27:03.316 --> 00:27:04.292
If my--

00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:07.280
If my soul mate is my best friend...

00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:11.119
That’ll be awkward.

00:27:12.574 --> 00:27:13.449
Or…

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.818
What if you're a man...

00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:19.056
and I am too?

00:27:19.688 --> 00:27:20.360
Or…

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.079
What if I were a woman...

00:27:22.754 --> 00:27:25.156
but you turn out to be gay?

00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:27.910
Or what if I'm ugly?
and you turn out to be uglier?

00:27:28.023 --> 00:27:30.175
What if I'm a cockroach
and you're a slipper?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.690
Isn’t that what makes love
fun and thrilling?

00:27:33.904 --> 00:27:36.838
Both a game and... a challenge?

00:27:36.896 --> 00:27:40.924
Whatever challenge comes our way
we'll overcome it.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.358
But it’ll be difficult.

00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:43.504
Difficult,

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.284
but fulfilling.

00:27:45.543 --> 00:27:46.676
For example,

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.926
When we meet again…

00:27:49.114 --> 00:27:50.021
“Hi.”

00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:51.252
“Hi.”

00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:58.146
Our hearts are overflowing with joy
because we’re whole again.

00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:00.417
Four feet.

00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:02.752
Four arms, two heads.

00:28:02.777 --> 00:28:03.692
Boom!

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.445
But

00:28:05.498 --> 00:28:06.839
what if...

00:28:06.994 --> 00:28:09.280
we don’t meet in our next life?

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.241
We will.

00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.247
What if we don’t?

00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:15.301
We'll live again and again.

00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:17.961
Nonstop?

00:28:17.992 --> 00:28:20.609
Just like you.
Over and over and over.

00:28:36.443 --> 00:28:38.866
Just remember...

00:28:42.561 --> 00:28:45.054
The heart always knows.

00:28:46.517 --> 00:28:48.517
The heart always knows.

00:28:48.683 --> 00:28:50.154
The heart...

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:51.491
always knows.

00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:53.559
The heart always knows.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:29:00.425
♫♪ The heart always knows. ♫♪

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:06.963
♫♪ The heart always knows. ♫♪

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.862
♫♪ My heart is tired. ♫♪

00:29:08.887 --> 00:29:10.885
♫♪ My heart is tired. ♫♪

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.650
♫♪ My heart is--

00:29:12.675 --> 00:29:13.380
What?

00:29:15.683 --> 00:29:18.276
My heart is...tired.

00:29:31.148 --> 00:29:32.694
What’s going to happen to you now?

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:36.398
I will live...

00:29:37.298 --> 00:29:38.130
alone.

00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:42.517
I don't think I can continue
searching for you...

00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.171
only to lose you for the nth time.

00:29:47.754 --> 00:29:49.231
What’s going to happen..

00:29:49.274 --> 00:29:50.215
To us?

00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:51.495
To me?

00:30:02.306 --> 00:30:04.013
You’re so unfair.

00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:06.614
Just like that?

00:30:06.677 --> 00:30:09.541
You’re going to destroy
this entire soul mate system?

00:30:09.826 --> 00:30:11.431
It’s not always difficult!

00:30:12.176 --> 00:30:15.919
Sometimes we meet effortlessly.
Sometimes we’re together for a long time.

00:30:18.796 --> 00:30:20.249
Isn't it enough that...

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.038
Those moments when you're with your other half?

00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:28.828
Marching along with hands entwined.

00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:31.259
Until you're both old.

00:30:31.384 --> 00:30:35.526
Falling asleep together
while watching the sunset.

00:30:36.388 --> 00:30:39.506
Wearing each other’s dentures by mistake.

00:30:43.436 --> 00:30:47.143
Who wouldn’t be captivated by those moments?

00:30:47.944 --> 00:30:51.848
Anyone would be willing
to give up her life for a moment…

00:30:51.873 --> 00:30:52.904
Or even--

00:30:52.967 --> 00:30:55.908
Even for a momentary promise of pure love?

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:57.988
But you're a fool!

00:30:58.778 --> 00:31:02.884
A fool is someone who refuses
to accept the call of fate.

00:31:07.635 --> 00:31:09.078
What if...

00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:12.862
What if in the search for that love...

00:31:13.302 --> 00:31:14.619
You hurt a lot of people?

00:31:14.644 --> 00:31:17.730
That’s their problem!
They're following their own fate.

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.901
That's what you're going to say to mom?

00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:23.954
You convinced her you were
her other half when you weren't.

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:25.587
When I first met your mother,

00:31:25.612 --> 00:31:27.276
I knew there was
something unique about her.

00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:29.018
I courted her for a long time.

00:31:29.043 --> 00:31:34.468
She made me think that
I was hers and she was mine!

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:40.111
But you were just emerging through her eyes.

00:31:40.136 --> 00:31:43.675
Until we got married and you were born.
That was when I saw the light.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.541
It’s not my fault that we
were meant to be together.

00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:47.764
Then who...

00:31:49.084 --> 00:31:50.371
Whose fault is it?

00:31:50.396 --> 00:31:52.632
In love, no one's at fault!

00:31:52.776 --> 00:31:54.798
We just need to take a risk!

00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:56.630
I have nothing left to risk!

00:31:56.655 --> 00:31:58.022
I’ll lend you mine!

00:31:58.078 --> 00:32:00.768
I have more than enough love
for both of us!

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.455
It’s no one’s fault.

00:32:13.273 --> 00:32:15.492
When something happened
when I was 16...

00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:17.687
It was no one’s fault?

00:32:21.562 --> 00:32:24.793
And most of all, we both hurt mom.

00:32:25.128 --> 00:32:27.986
She was a flower that slowly withered.

00:32:28.204 --> 00:32:30.576
I saw how her life was destroyed.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.358
Because of our love.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.880
And you're saying...

00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:36.672
It was no one’s fault?

00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:40.524
Hey!

00:32:40.565 --> 00:32:41.721
Hey!

00:32:42.244 --> 00:32:46.899
Whoever you are,
whoever is in control, it’s your--

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:49.275
It's your fault!

00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:03.867
Please give us more time.

00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:19.513
My whole life, I pledged to be with you.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.184
They can make me a soldier.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.198
You are the land I cannot abandon.

00:33:26.494 --> 00:33:27.689
Come here.

00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:33.158
You cannot escape from me.

00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:39.777
We'll keep going
until fate is finally on our side.

00:33:39.802 --> 00:33:41.904
All we have to do is hold on.

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:42.874
Tightly.

00:33:42.913 --> 00:33:44.438
With all our might.

00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:47.133
Soul mate…

00:33:49.686 --> 00:33:52.421
I can’t bear to hurt someone else again.

00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:53.469
Sorry--

00:33:53.584 --> 00:33:55.837
Sorry, I can't.

00:33:55.882 --> 00:33:57.458
Sorry, I'm tired.

00:33:57.483 --> 00:33:58.605
Sorry.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.833
You have no choice!

00:34:04.412 --> 00:34:08.249
I’m going to follow you wherever you go.

00:34:11.442 --> 00:34:13.374
You can’t escape from me.

00:34:13.407 --> 00:34:16.189
I’ll follow you wherever you go.

00:34:21.788 --> 00:34:23.962
And if our paths don’t cross...

00:34:26.702 --> 00:34:28.662
I will not hesitate..

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.542
To take your life.

00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:35.597
You’re going to kill me?

00:34:39.113 --> 00:34:43.020
Over and over
until everything is right again.

00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:54.784
I love you.

00:34:57.317 --> 00:34:58.934
I love you very much.

00:34:59.045 --> 00:34:59.992
Say it...

00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:01.381
Say you love me, too.

00:35:01.972 --> 00:35:03.135
Say it.

00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:23.769
Thank you.

00:37:13.817 --> 00:37:14.817
You.

00:37:15.728 --> 00:37:18.294
You’ve been looking for
your soul mate for sometime right?

00:37:47.664 --> 00:37:49.253
A new dawn.

00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.385
A new birth.

00:38:07.857 --> 00:38:09.052
Come.

00:38:09.403 --> 00:38:11.981
Let’s begin our chase once again.
