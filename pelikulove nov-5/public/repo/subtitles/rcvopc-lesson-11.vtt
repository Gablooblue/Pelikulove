00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:14.491
But wait!

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.688
Before you write your first draft,

00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:21.151
you should first learn

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:25.396
the format of the script.

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:34.386
This isn’t usually taught
in playwriting workshops.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.086
I don't understand why
because this is important to me.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.978
I just realized
that it’s not just the story,

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:48.417
the play itself, or the dialogue
that’s important,

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:52.769
but also how you present
your script as well.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:56.401
Especially when you give it
to the director and actors.

00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:00.413
There's a reason why
there's a format to the script.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:07.191
It's not just because
it looks pleasant or professional,

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:08.738
well partly, yes.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:15.210
There's a standard format
that scriptwriters follow.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.762
There's a standard in screenwriting,
playwriting, and even in musicals.

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:06.290
So that when you submit your script,

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:10.852
even if they haven't read it yet,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.102
the production team would think
that you're serious about your work.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:18.283
‘Cause that happened to me.

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:22.269
I wrote a script
on a piece of notebook paper.

00:04:22.683 --> 00:04:24.363
I wrote it like that.

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:26.051
I passed it like that.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.650
I got scolded.

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.410
The script looked like
it got raked by chickens.

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:31.994
So the producer didn’t read it.

00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:34.125
We have to prevent
those things from happening.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.375
What's important is
it gets read and evaluated

00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:46.392
because if you present it properly,

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:52.318
they'll present an opportunity
to you in no time.

00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:56.353
Remember that you wrote
your script to be performed.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.839
And because you wrote
it to be performed,

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.347
the one who needs
to understand this should be

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:06.570
the director, actors,
technical people, designers,

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:09.477
and the rest of the production team
have to understand your script.

00:05:09.632 --> 00:05:17.005
They already have a language
so you better use that to avoid confusion.

00:05:17.578 --> 00:05:18.108
Okay?

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.703
So now, right now!

00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:22.812
Write your very first draft.

00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:24.924
I'm going to wait for it!
