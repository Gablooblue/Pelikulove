00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:19.082
One of the biggest problems of writers

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:25.423
whether beginner or experienced

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.953
is how to pinpoint exactly what
they want to say in the play in a word or two.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:42.296
People often ask,
"What's the premise of the play?"

00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:50.144
It's fine if the premise
is clear to you.

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:55.508
But if you can't explain
what the premise is

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:57.976
something must be wrong.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:09.104
Again, it's difficult to set
a formula on how to write,

00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:12.431
and premise denotes
a lot of things.

00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:21.226
Some people teach premise
as the overall theme.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.505
So you wonder what it is.

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:27.891
Is it love? freedom?

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.976
It's the theme,
so like theme of justice?

00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:36.348
Something like that.

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:51.397
Lajos Egri is, of course, most noted
for his works on playwriting.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:02:01.202
He articulated the concept of premise
as a guide for the writer

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:10.780
so that she doesn't lose sight
of her play's flow and direction,

00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:14.606
or the story or arc of her play.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.859
And he separated
the three elements

00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:24.498
on how to form a play.

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:27.890
The first element is the character.

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:33.034
The second element
is the conflict the character faces.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:37.964
Again, we go back
to objective and obstacle

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:44.442
which would naturally be concluded
by the end of the play.

00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:46.641
Which prevailed?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.391
The obstacle or the character?

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.966
The premise is that simple.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:59.438
So Lajos cites as example

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.634
the premise about...

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.506
selfishness

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:20.029
leading to one’s own grave.

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:25.538
The selfishness
will be manifested

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.950
by the character

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:38.250
and the play will show how
she digs herself a grave.

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:41.795
According to Egri,

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.984
Macbeth followed
such a premise.

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:50.988
It's clear that the character's
extreme selfishness

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.680
helped him reach
the peak of his power,

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.062
but his selfishness
was also his downfall.

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:10.270
So whatever part of the story

00:04:10.504 --> 00:04:13.255
that strays from that point

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:16.582
could be removed.

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:29.488
Even if you read
the entire play today,

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:33.547
of course, there are
some parts that stray.

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:41.410
Like the witches' game,
where the witches have a long ritual.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.533
If you're the director,
you could probably remove that

00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:55.492
since you can't align it
with the main direction of the premise.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.544
True love overcomes death.

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.423
It's like West Side Story, right?

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:14.423
So 'true love' reveals the characters,
'overcomes' reveals the conflict,

00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:16.887
and 'death' reveals the conclusion.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.559
When you formulate it,
it seems simple.

00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:28.542
But when you dig deep into the story,
that's when all the details come out.

00:05:28.573 --> 00:05:35.742
That's when you can expand it
since it's not all about love.

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:38.656
To show love,

00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:43.651
you have to show the feud
between the two families, right?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.618
So you will also have
to expand on that feud.

00:05:48.778 --> 00:05:52.206
And you will have to show

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:56.341
how love overcomes death.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.010
Big words emerge.

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:02.717
But most of the time,

00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:07.448
you’re not able to pinpoint
that out from the beginning.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.618
In fact,

00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:14.043
 I'm almost inclined to say
that even when you’ve finished the play

00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:16.995
you probably can’t word it
exactly as such.

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:21.825
Yet you feel it's over.

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:28.112
What I mean is
not all plays are like that.

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:33.160
Some plays have
different episodes

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.059
and you can't really set it,

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.676
but it's important for
the writer to say

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:52.068
the play's direction
in one sentence.

00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.642
If that's not clear,

00:06:56.821 --> 00:07:04.525
then it means the play's
direction still isn't clear.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.520
Now when should it be clear to you?

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:16.517
That's where we have our differences.

00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:20.327
Others need a clear premise first
before actually writing.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.624
I'm not like that.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.140
Like I said,
I could be moved

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:31.583
by a character's life and
I could just follow her.

00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:37.017
I may not know
the basic premise yet

00:07:37.202 --> 00:07:40.057
so in the course of writing it,

00:07:40.672 --> 00:07:45.033
that’s when its conclusion
becomes clear to me.

00:07:47.493 --> 00:07:53.321
The premise could become
clearer in the middle

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:57.267
because the end
is still unknown to me.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:08:00.253
That's what writers
usually go through.

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:10.448
Or I know how it ends
but the character's journey seems off.

00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:17.293
But I've never written a play

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:21.597
where I had to
change the character

00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:27.073
because she couldn't
get to the conclusion.

00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:29.558
It has never come to that.

00:08:30.483 --> 00:08:35.237
Your choice of character
is usually

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:44.419
what'll give you a clue

00:08:44.748 --> 00:08:48.690
in terms of the
direction she'll take.

00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:53.792
There are cases
while writing your play

00:08:55.287 --> 00:08:57.809
where you think
this is the protagonist

00:08:57.918 --> 00:09:00.331
because you started with her.

00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:04.609
But the other main character
seems more dramatic,

00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:14.721
the other character's story
seems more interesting

00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:17.535
instead of the protagonist.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:25.886
This happens probably because
when you chose that character

00:09:26.134 --> 00:09:31.571
you thought she'd be the one
who'll move the story forward to the end.

00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:34.759
But actually this other character

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:40.063
might be the one
to push towards the conclusion.

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:46.993
You could adjust to that character
to get the story further

00:09:47.435 --> 00:09:49.076
- Is it like a hypothesis

00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:52.690
where you have an assumption
and then you test it while writing it.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:57.057
Is it like your guide, until later on,
when you’re able to prove it or not?

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.282
It could be like that.

00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:01.543
Or you could be done
with the story,

00:10:01.593 --> 00:10:06.293
but in order to check if the story's
direction is going somewhere

00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:10.037
can you formulate it
like a hypothesis?

00:10:11.115 --> 00:10:14.089
Because if you can't
formulate it, it could mean

00:10:14.152 --> 00:10:23.382
there’s something not quite right,
in terms of the logical argument of the play.

00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:28.266
The premise isn’t the only
important thing for me as a writer.

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.342
The premise isn't the be all and end all.

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:35.627
It doesn't mean that
when I've written my premise

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:38.648
and followed it,
my play's already good.

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:40.890
It's not like that.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.503
It's more of a guide.

00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:46.469
Like a ruler

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:48.862
guiding you to the moon.

00:10:52.992 --> 00:10:54.819
Formulating a premise is like that.

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:58.498
Anything that goes against that
won’t lead to the moon.

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:00.834
But what if that’s better?

00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:08.287
So change the premise.
That’s possible.

00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:12.624
Whatever it is,

00:11:12.815 --> 00:11:19.232
when the direction you want
for your play becomes clear,

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:24.985
you should know it at least
before you finish writing.

00:11:25.183 --> 00:11:27.477
It doesn't have to be done
in the beginning.

00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:30.946
It doesn't mean
it should all be figured out

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:40.050
The play's direction is part
of the process you have to identify.

00:11:42.057 --> 00:11:44.526
It doesn’t need
to be in the beginning,

00:11:44.598 --> 00:11:46.286
it could be near the end

00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:48.200
or in the middle.

00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:51.845
where you know more
about the character,

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:56.002
know more about her struggles.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.387
That's the significance of the premise.

00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:07.453
Especially when you're lost.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.848
When you have so many characters
that you don't know who to focus on

00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:17.398
and what story to highlight.
