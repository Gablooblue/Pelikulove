00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:04.967
There's a reason to remember the past,
for there we may find the truth and courage to move on.

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:13.358
Ladies Who Launch organized
"Never Again: Voices of Martial Law"
in Bantayog ng mga Bayani last September 2016.

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.538
Nine stories. Majority of these
are based on real life accounts.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.063
One of these is Indigo Child.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.008
This play-on video was made possible
with the help of the following:

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:30.083
UP Film Institute, Ladies Who Launch
Bantayog ng mga Bayani, Rey Agapay

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:38.323
It wasn’t lighting that showed man
the concept of electricity.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.994
Lightning then,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:43.863
was a sign of the wrath of gods.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.305
But for us who live in this hi-tech age,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.302
it’s easy to think of lightning as electricity.

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.437
They say that lightning
was first trapped in a kite.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.880
And that was how we learned
to create electricity.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.602
Since then, humans became powerful.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.531
We could make things work and move.

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:05.168
Light,

00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:05.842
cars,

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:06.792
other forms of transportation,

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:07.361
communication,

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:08.368
everything.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.590
We created cities,

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:13.553
an entire world brought to life
by electricity.

00:01:13.577 --> 00:01:16.191
Civilizations weren’t founded
on fire any longer.

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:19.916
From the rapid flow of electricity,
machines were created.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.197
And soon, computers, robots.

00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:27.763
We’ve created a planet
that lights up even at night

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.590
I wasn’t aware back then.

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.319
But now that I’m going to see Mama,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.710
I realized that maybe the reason

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:47.618
I took up Electrical Engineering was…

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:50.253
because of her.

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:03.925
Not Benjamin Franklin,
nor Michael Faraday, nor Thomas Edison,

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.341
not even Albert Einstein.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:11.847
Perhaps no one else knows more
about electricity than my own mother.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.180
When I first saw her

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:15.949
three weeks ago,

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.363
she was still in shock.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.024
Doctors advised me
to visit some other time.

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:24.427
They told me she might not be ready…

00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:26.757
or maybe, I won’t be ready to see her.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:29.216
But I told them I can handle it.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.772
I can see my mother
even if she’s spaced out.

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:43.890
Mama.

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:17.968
She hasn’t regained
full control of her mouth.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:00.500
She was still in shock.

00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:04.348
She almost didn’t recognize me.

00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:09.292
Her eyes were dull.

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:36.657
Ma.

00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:38.162
Careful.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:57.895
Ma.

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:02.499
Ma.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:05.971
I’m here.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.699
Ma.

00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:18.227
I'm here.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.548
Jerome is here

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.655
Jerome.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:51.037
Jerome!

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.941
Of course, I know you.

00:05:58.338 --> 00:05:59.612
- Are you fetching me?

00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:00.638
- Ma.

00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:04.684
I thought I was going to get shocked
by electricity myself.

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.319
What did you think

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.826
I just thought--

00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:14.163
there might still be
electricity left in your body.

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:19.556
Like this.

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:23.647
Crazy.

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:25.369
What do you think of me?

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.576
You can take anything.

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.773
I thought that maybe--

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:35.412
after your body
has absorbed the electricity,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.430
you could light up a bulb.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.904
How I wish.

00:06:48.217 --> 00:06:51.343
So we don’t have to pay

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:54.452
the electric bill.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.837
She could afford to make jokes
three days after her ECT.

00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:04.458
I was relieved,

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:09.393
that way we didn’t need
to talk about serious stuff.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:12.995
I figured

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:16.441
she remembered the procedure
she just went through.

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.420
What are we talking about?

00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:19.555
What did you say, Ma?

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:21.312
What are we talking about?

00:07:22.073 --> 00:07:24.011
Weren’t you conscious?

00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:27.242
Conscious?

00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.261
Of what?

00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:31.221
What you went through...

00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.233
What do you mean?

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:36.245
Electroconvulsive therapy?

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:41.164
Electroconvulsive thera...

00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:42.858
Oh!

00:07:43.102 --> 00:07:44.272
Is that what it was?

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.502
At that time, I thought

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:49.352
the memories were just coming back.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.536
Like

00:08:08.902 --> 00:08:11.651
flash photography.

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:13.130
That's it!

00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:14.541
Like

00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:16.763
flash photography.

00:08:16.907 --> 00:08:18.080
Here

00:08:18.143 --> 00:08:19.515
in my head.

00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:21.258
That’s what I remembered.

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:24.864
Was it painful?

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:26.191
Painful?

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:27.410
Which one?

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:30.244
The flashes of memories?

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:31.355
They were painful.

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:33.500
So they gave me the electric shock.

00:08:34.134 --> 00:08:34.820
You rascal.

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:36.062
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:08:36.087 --> 00:08:36.916
Did I agree to it?

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:38.881
We discussed it.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.673
I told you it’d be good for you.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.538
I don’t remember giving my consent.

00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:47.216
That was Dr. Medina’s recommendation.

00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:51.242
Why do they like burning people's insides?

00:08:52.902 --> 00:08:54.870
I couldn’t stop you.

00:08:54.983 --> 00:08:56.662
You were doing all sorts of things to yourself.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:59.163
Why do they like burning me inside?

00:08:59.444 --> 00:09:02.129
You haven’t been responding to the medication.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.958
Besides, it was just a one-time treatment.

00:09:03.983 --> 00:09:04.790
Of course not.

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:06.310
This is the second time.

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:07.584
Ma? You’re mistaken--

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:13.703
No.

00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:15.283
This is the second time.

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.752
Only, the first one took longer.
And I wasn’t unconscious then.

00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:24.304
Which is why this time,
all the memories came flashing back.

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:26.133
I thought they’ve really come back.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.075
They?

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:28.988
Kidlat (Lightning).

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:31.328
Kidlat.

00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:38.844
They named him Kidlat.

00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:42.527
At first I didn’t know why, until..

00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:49.198
Ma.

00:09:59.202 --> 00:10:02.808
It was Kidlat who would attach
the wires to my toes.

00:10:03.362 --> 00:10:05.434
Sometimes he’d attach them to my fingers.

00:10:05.532 --> 00:10:07.160
Other times, to my ears.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:08.763
My nipples.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.097
My vagina.

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:12.827
My…

00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:27.103
So that’s why...

00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:30.479
his face suddenly flashed in my mind.

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:32.912
I suddenly remembered everything.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.254
Even that.

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:37.395
That!

00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.221
Even the mole on his forehead,
I remembered.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:44.016
I used to stare at his mole...

00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:46.890
hoping that if I did,
the shock wouldn’t be so painful.

00:10:47.032 --> 00:10:48.232
Did my nose bleed?

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.529
I don’t know.

00:10:49.592 --> 00:10:50.810
What did the doctor say?

00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:53.004
He didn’t mention anything.

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:55.742
Because it bled the first time.

00:10:56.032 --> 00:10:58.104
Then I saw Kidlat,

00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:00.793
he got momentarily anxious.

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:02.189
Of course, because

00:11:02.726 --> 00:11:05.274
if my organs got fried,

00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:09.935
I’d instantly die, right?

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:15.536
So I didn’t remove my eyes on his mole.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.065
That scared him a little.

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:18.052
And he stopped.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.211
Ma... I’m sorry.

00:11:22.304 --> 00:11:23.570
Sorry, Ma.

00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:26.935
I had no idea

00:11:27.328 --> 00:11:29.395
it would trigger bad memories--

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:34.098
It’s not your fault, son.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.235
I did have second thoughts
before agreeing to it.

00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:49.069
When Dr. Medina suggested
shock therapy, I got scared, too.

00:11:50.158 --> 00:11:54.900
I didn’t think these memories would...

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:56.658
Maybe it was necessary.

00:11:58.528 --> 00:11:59.752
You know...

00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:02.828
That’s what they called it, too.

00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:04.027
Which one?

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:05.585
"Shock therapy."

00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:07.102
Kidlat said

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:08.701
that we were sick.

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:09.819
Terribly sick.

00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:12.631
A sickness called ca--

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:14.465
Cancer.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:16.103
Fucking shit. That bastard.

00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:18.146
They said I had a tumor in my brain.

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:22.670
They needed to burn all that
communist dogma they put in my brain.

00:12:22.778 --> 00:12:24.770
That was the mission order.

00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:26.965
"Discipline is necessary!"

00:12:27.195 --> 00:12:30.707
Discipline!

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.133
They had to get it out of...

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.612
our system…

00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:36.317
system…

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.990
It was a war of opposing systems.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:43.329
The system we were advocating
against the system they were protecting.

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.877
They repeated it over and over.

00:12:45.913 --> 00:12:47.259
It left me in a daze.

00:12:47.282 --> 00:12:50.185
That’s why I repeated
a different mantra in my head.

00:12:50.263 --> 00:12:52.089
Louder and louder.

00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:57.738
“Stupid jerks! American puppets!"

00:12:57.806 --> 00:13:00.278
"Down with imperialism!"

00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:02.581
"Down with feudalism!"

00:13:02.623 --> 00:13:06.279
"Down with kutukatak-ism..."

00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:08.423
I heard that at a rally once...

00:13:08.447 --> 00:13:11.798
You know those young cigarette vendors?
"Takatak boys."

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:12.742
One of them chanted,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.960
“Down with Kutukatak-ism!”

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.849
Did I tell him that? I don’t recall now.

00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:22.604
All I know was that I remained brave
even if I was getting delirious.

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:24.078
“You don’t have a system!"

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:29.795
"Down with all of you,
you stupid puppets!”

00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:33.537
Wow!

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:35.507
I sound like a true activist eh?

00:13:35.628 --> 00:13:37.267
Ma...do you want us to talk another time?

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.047
Why?

00:13:38.212 --> 00:13:39.524
All these bad memories are--

00:13:39.544 --> 00:13:40.278
Stay right there!

00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:42.318
I’ve buried these memories for so long.

00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:43.973
Fucking shit!

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:46.274
But they’re still in my head.

00:13:46.332 --> 00:13:50.678
I thought that all along,
these memories have...

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:52.422
dissipated.

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:59.482
Do you remember the teachings
of Sri Abundoramiswamy?

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:01.758
Tani!

00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:06.460
You don't know him.

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.625
Tani was a comrade.

00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:15.352
After our release from prison,
his name was still Tani.

00:14:17.078 --> 00:14:18.751
Your father told me

00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:21.178
Tani didn’t want to go back to the movement.

00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:26.907
So I asked him why.

00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:29.249
He stared at me.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.826
Your father...

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:34.327
Your father told me he understands.

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:37.279
He said Tani lost his manhood in prison.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:39.023
What do you mean?

00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:46.971
I didn’t know either.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.243
But I had my suspicions.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.592
After a couple of years,

00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:54.302
we met again.

00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:56.734
Your father had already passed away.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.029
And me,

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:01.343
I was seen walking
like a zombie on the street.

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.210
I was discharged from the movement.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.968
Someone was just
looking out for me.

00:15:04.993 --> 00:15:06.710
You must have been 12
years old at that time...

00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:08.492
You didn’t share that with me.

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:09.777
Of course,

00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:11.471
I didn’t tell you anything.

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:13.556
I didn’t tell anyone about this.

00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:14.635
Why?

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:16.926
I always asked you, didn’t I?

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:18.594
How did my father die?

00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:19.978
You already know that.

00:15:20.018 --> 00:15:20.648
Bang!

00:15:21.102 --> 00:15:21.887
He was shot.

00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:23.012
Dead.

00:15:26.973 --> 00:15:28.972
That’s how I wanted to die back then.

00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:32.444
Together with your father.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.058
There was a time in my life...

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:35.847
No,

00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:37.391
Our lives...

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:39.188
I didn’t know whether...

00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:42.571
we were already in hell

00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:45.421
or we were just on our way.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.128
I asked your father

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:51.556
if we’re already in hell,
then what’s the difference?

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.051
We were going to die
and end up there anyway.

00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:57.033
Dad wasn’t like that!

00:15:57.058 --> 00:15:58.527
Grandma didn’t talk about him that way.

00:15:58.552 --> 00:15:59.321
You’re right.

00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:01.749
Your father said...

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600
Heaven...

00:16:05.492 --> 00:16:09.671
He said to die for the country is Heaven.

00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:15.185
I thought dying then never felt more tempting.

00:16:15.213 --> 00:16:16.700
Ma, you must be tired.

00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:17.854
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:21.224
Can’t you see how excited I am
to tell you all this?

00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:23.702
Once the shock therapy’s effects wane,

00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:25.221
I’ll forget all this.

00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:26.434
I won’t be able to tell you the stories.

00:16:26.454 --> 00:16:27.650
Now’s the right time.

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:30.301
Tani...

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:31.560
I saw him again.

00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:35.387
"Tani!" I called.

00:16:37.557 --> 00:16:40.937
I called him but he just looked at me and said,

00:16:43.397 --> 00:16:45.550
“I am not Tani."

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.744
"My name is Sri Abundoramiswamy.”

00:16:58.805 --> 00:17:02.174
What the fuck!

00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:10.371
He went to India

00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:13.009
to search for his Self, he said.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.176
And when he found his wounded self,

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:18.553
he finally killed it

00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:21.484
and laid it to rest.

00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.679
“Tani’s dead”, he said.

00:17:26.594 --> 00:17:31.205
Here, now, is Sri Abundoramiswamy.

00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:33.077
New soul,

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:37.644
bought from India at the price
of thirty meditation sessions...

00:17:39.444 --> 00:17:41.539
I was impressed. I told him,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.204
"Teacher,"

00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:46.352
"teach me."

00:17:46.976 --> 00:17:48.889
And he taught me

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.912
how to contemplate on my trauma
using the eye of my inner consciousness.

00:17:54.753 --> 00:17:57.051
Every whack,

00:17:57.238 --> 00:17:59.225
every shock,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.561
every strike,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.554
I meditated on each one of them.

00:18:05.008 --> 00:18:09.390
Including Kidlat’s mole.

00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:12.133
I meditated and afterwards,

00:18:12.564 --> 00:18:17.853
I saw how they slowly dissipated.

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:19.787
I saw them melt

00:18:19.944 --> 00:18:20.944
and turn into

00:18:22.594 --> 00:18:23.853
smoke.

00:18:28.968 --> 00:18:32.330
Bye!

00:18:32.514 --> 00:18:36.163
I bid all the bad memories goodbye.

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:39.482
I was so sure they were all gone.

00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:42.715
That’s why when I looked for you

00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:45.608
and took you from your grandmother,

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:47.319
I swear,

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.095
I didn’t remember anything, son.

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:52.222
"Well and good," I said.

00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:55.174
I could take you far away.
To protect you.

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:58.807
Whatever happened to your father and I…

00:18:58.892 --> 00:18:59.928
is between us.

00:19:00.162 --> 00:19:02.203
All you need to know...

00:19:02.313 --> 00:19:03.795
was we fought for our country.

00:19:04.514 --> 00:19:07.156
Your father died for the motherland.

00:19:07.222 --> 00:19:08.009
I...

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.515
was tortured for the motherland.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600
That’s why.

00:19:16.297 --> 00:19:17.993
You took me away from Grandma.

00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:19.452
You took me away from everyone.

00:19:19.476 --> 00:19:20.723
Including your comrades.

00:19:22.497 --> 00:19:23.713
You said

00:19:24.401 --> 00:19:25.694
that it was just the two of us.

00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:28.702
Like this.

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.582
You took me away.

00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:33.573
From your past. From history.

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:37.227
Even though we both knew
it was impossible.

00:19:40.094 --> 00:19:41.951
You even changed your name.

00:19:45.007 --> 00:19:46.221
Do you remember?

00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:48.502
I was 15 when you told me...

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.097
- To call you Felisa.
- Felisa.

00:19:52.246 --> 00:19:54.172
Ma, not Nanay.

00:19:54.743 --> 00:20:02.633
Because every time you called me that,
an electric current went right through me.

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:15.967
I wanted to forget everything,
even my name.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.190
You knew that, right?

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.936
Do you still remember
your real name, Ma?

00:20:29.073 --> 00:20:31.849
I know it’s just there
at the back of my head.

00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:34.765
Do you want to remember?

00:20:35.137 --> 00:20:36.977
Don’t you dare mention it if you know.

00:20:41.602 --> 00:20:42.571
Sorry.

00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:43.873
Nanay!

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:58.662
Didn’t Dr. Medina say
that this was going to be the side effect?

00:20:58.732 --> 00:21:00.895
They fried my brain...

00:21:00.957 --> 00:21:03.882
naturally, that opened
doors and windows.

00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:08.805
Everything started coming back.

00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:24.613
Do you know?

00:21:26.363 --> 00:21:31.957
What I remembered
while Kidlat was electrocuting me?

00:21:33.124 --> 00:21:37.540
In the midst of all that pain,

00:21:38.145 --> 00:21:40.309
I remembered...

00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:43.702
being kissed by a man.

00:21:45.655 --> 00:21:47.040
Can you imagine?

00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:50.647
I was just a baby and yet
I already had that in my memory.

00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:53.413
That must have been
my earliest recollection.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:57.783
I was in someone’s arms.
Maybe Mama’s or Papa’s.

00:21:58.221 --> 00:22:01.588
And then, there was a man
who couldn’t help himself

00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:05.823
He was so delighted with me.

00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:11.584
He kissed me.

00:22:13.062 --> 00:22:15.590
For a moment...

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:19.760
for a moment I felt the joy

00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:22.441
of being kissed without asking for it.

00:22:22.832 --> 00:22:24.503
That feeling of...

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.977
surprise

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.281
and joy.

00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:30.723
Then I felt shame.

00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:32.271
Then I...

00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:34.067
cried

00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:36.871
and cried

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.847
and cried.

00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:43.699
But when I was being tortured with a live wire,

00:22:44.022 --> 00:22:47.627
when I was trembling
because of the high voltage,

00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:54.714
I was brought back
to that single moment of utter joy.

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:58.971
The feeling that came
after surprise and before shame.

00:22:59.143 --> 00:23:00.684
I stayed in that moment

00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:03.806
until the electricity
went out of my body.

00:23:07.398 --> 00:23:09.695
That’s why Kidlat was astonished.

00:23:09.781 --> 00:23:12.200
He said I was already unconscious

00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.604
but I was still smiling.

00:23:13.629 --> 00:23:14.831
Where is he?

00:23:17.847 --> 00:23:18.847
What?

00:23:19.251 --> 00:23:21.211
Where is he?
Don’t you remember?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.304
The man?

00:23:23.837 --> 00:23:25.390
I don't know.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.332
But I remember his face.

00:23:27.395 --> 00:23:28.395
Kidlat.

00:23:28.552 --> 00:23:32.234
Did you see him again after your release?
After Martial Law?  Not even once?

00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:34.334
On TV.

00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:35.643
On TV?

00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:37.510
When Marcos fled.

00:23:37.694 --> 00:23:41.511
He was shaking hands
with the people in EDSA.

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:44.205
He had flowers on his beret.

00:23:44.393 --> 00:23:46.267
He and his comrades
were hailed as heroes.

00:23:46.354 --> 00:23:48.770
People said what they did
was also for our country.

00:23:48.808 --> 00:23:50.468
Who is Kidlat?

00:23:50.558 --> 00:23:52.311
One of those
who broke away from Marcos.

00:23:52.374 --> 00:23:53.759
What’s his name?

00:23:54.007 --> 00:23:56.236
What for?
I just want his memory to dissipate.

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:57.879
Didn’t you try looking for him afterwards?

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.085
No. We were far away from it already.
I didn’t want to see him.

00:24:00.122 --> 00:24:02.560
- Did Dad know him?
- Of course. Your dad knew everything.

00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:04.055
Why didn’t Dad look for him?

00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:07.001
Because I told him not to!
He’s already dead to me anyway!

00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:10.787
Stop playing dumb, Ma!

00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:15.165
You know you can’t forget that man
because he’s the one who made you like this!

00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:18.048
Ma!

00:24:30.963 --> 00:24:32.138
In the end...

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.775
I turned out like this because...

00:24:38.716 --> 00:24:41.317
I couldn’t handle myself.

00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:44.265
In spite of...

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:47.022
meditating...

00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:49.334
therapy, medicine...

00:24:49.469 --> 00:24:53.269
trying to make
everything about him dissipate...

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:57.994
I still can’t...

00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:03.379
I still can't make it disappear.

00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:19.329
And now...

00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:21.955
Now that they've burned my insides again,

00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:24.729
he has returned.

00:25:26.921 --> 00:25:29.316
He’s still alive.

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:33.268
There’s a meaning
behind all these.

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:35.304
You know?

00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:39.202
Situations like this...

00:25:39.835 --> 00:25:41.432
They happen for a reason.

00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:46.144
The reason I remember...

00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:48.363
and in your presence…

00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.818
That’s it!

00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:56.839
I’ve got it, my son.

00:25:57.098 --> 00:25:58.966
That’s why I can’t get it out of my mind.

00:25:58.997 --> 00:26:00.411
In spite of all my efforts.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.298
Why I didn’t divulge this to anyone was because...

00:26:03.404 --> 00:26:05.985
it was waiting to be told.

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:08.666
And not just to anyone.

00:26:10.674 --> 00:26:13.005
But to you.

00:26:13.047 --> 00:26:14.468
My son.

00:26:15.937 --> 00:26:16.668
Ma.

00:26:26.613 --> 00:26:28.527
Even if you didn’t tell me,

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:30.808
you think I didn’t know?

00:26:36.726 --> 00:26:37.726
I knew.

00:26:39.862 --> 00:26:42.249
Even when we had moved away.

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:46.407
And you refused
to contact your comrades.

00:26:46.454 --> 00:26:47.454
Even Grandma.

00:26:50.097 --> 00:26:51.731
I found out on my own.

00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:55.838
I know you were tortured, Ma.

00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:59.736
Maybe I don’t know every detail.
But Ma...

00:27:00.962 --> 00:27:02.673
There are people
who haven’t forgotten.

00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:05.790
There were people
who recorded the facts...

00:27:05.986 --> 00:27:07.427
recorded the details in history.

00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:09.441
Stored in the memory banks
of many people...

00:27:10.824 --> 00:27:12.050
Your friends.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.044
The people you left behind…

00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:18.094
They know and I know.

00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:22.884
And I want to tell you...I love you.

00:27:25.066 --> 00:27:27.425
And that I’ve admired you
from the start.

00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:32.945
Even if I don’t fully understand
what you and dad went through.

00:27:34.943 --> 00:27:36.922
They didn’t tell you.

00:27:37.586 --> 00:27:39.231
No one can tell the true story.

00:27:39.263 --> 00:27:40.145
Only I can.

00:27:42.442 --> 00:27:44.185
He’s not your father.

00:27:45.888 --> 00:27:48.622
You wouldn’t have become an indigo child,

00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:50.393
if he were your father.

00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:56.057
Indigo?

00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:59.121
I only found out
when I got you back.

00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:04.140
That was what
Abundoramiswamy said.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.957
You are...

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:07.801
an Indigo Child.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.324
You will break the chains
of non-stop misery...

00:28:13.581 --> 00:28:14.581
suffering...

00:28:14.727 --> 00:28:15.727
ignorance...

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:17.354
shallowness.

00:28:17.561 --> 00:28:21.415
You will rescue all of humanity
who has fallen

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:23.680
into the quagmire of the past.

00:28:24.227 --> 00:28:26.955
You are part of the new generation.

00:28:27.097 --> 00:28:29.234
That will open a new chapter.

00:28:29.414 --> 00:28:33.254
From the Age of Pisces
to the Age of Aquarius.

00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:34.654
And this is your time.

00:28:34.854 --> 00:28:35.782
- Ma.
- You,

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:38.187
together with other indigo children...

00:28:38.257 --> 00:28:39.791
borne of a revolution,

00:28:39.879 --> 00:28:42.192
fruit of conflict,
of rage, of crisis...

00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:46.115
you will raise
people’s consciousness.

00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:48.490
and shepherd people
when we cross the light band…

00:28:48.537 --> 00:28:52.281
towards the age
of new consciousness

00:28:52.303 --> 00:28:53.265
that’s more evolved...

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.626
more developed...

00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:56.193
more aware...

00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:57.294
Ma...

00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:03.507
What do you mean?

00:29:05.728 --> 00:29:07.201
Now it all makes sense...

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:10.899
why we reached this point, Jerome.

00:29:12.552 --> 00:29:13.552
Jerome, my son.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.697
It was a big mistake
that I hid all these from you.

00:29:19.151 --> 00:29:20.053
Because you!

00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:23.289
You are the fruit of all my hatred...

00:29:26.147 --> 00:29:27.646
Who is my father?

00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:30.632
Kidlat.

00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:03.387
I carried you.

00:30:04.379 --> 00:30:07.380
Debating every day...

00:30:08.404 --> 00:30:11.827
whether I should abort you or not.

00:30:12.768 --> 00:30:14.723
I consulted the movement.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.801
Some said it was alright for me
to have an abortion.

00:30:20.957 --> 00:30:23.035
They wouldn’t condemn me.

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:26.494
They would understand.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.253
And your father said...

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.889
He’d respect my decision.

00:30:36.421 --> 00:30:38.599
If I decide to keep you,

00:30:40.826 --> 00:30:42.069
he’d take care of you.

00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:46.125
He said we can teach you
to hate the soldiers.

00:30:46.266 --> 00:30:47.266
Who knows?

00:30:47.461 --> 00:30:48.461
He said.

00:30:49.371 --> 00:30:52.050
By a sudden dramatic turn of events,

00:30:52.807 --> 00:30:55.281
you might end up
killing your own father.

00:30:58.432 --> 00:31:00.166
I told your father...

00:31:01.494 --> 00:31:03.540
who by the way is not your real father...

00:31:04.368 --> 00:31:06.595
I killed Kidlat a long time ago.

00:31:08.707 --> 00:31:09.707
Here.

00:31:11.056 --> 00:31:13.791
And that was when
Abundoramiswamy and I realized...

00:31:14.893 --> 00:31:15.893
that you,

00:31:16.664 --> 00:31:18.067
child of arch-enemies...

00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:21.407
is the symbol of its ultimate union...

00:31:21.915 --> 00:31:29.539
The synthesis of opposing forces...

00:31:30.396 --> 00:31:32.546
You are the indigo child

00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:35.924
will open a new consciousness.

00:31:38.418 --> 00:31:39.006
Oh

00:31:39.046 --> 00:31:39.571
my

00:31:39.642 --> 00:31:40.375
God!

00:31:42.612 --> 00:31:43.612
My

00:31:44.162 --> 00:31:45.394
God!

00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:47.576
What a revelation!

00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:49.238
What a revelation, indeed.

00:31:49.546 --> 00:31:50.253
I feel...

00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:53.069
I feel liberated,
I feel fantastic release.

00:31:53.093 --> 00:31:55.618
It is as if I reached
a spiritual climax.

00:31:55.657 --> 00:31:56.665
- You know?
- Ma.

00:31:56.712 --> 00:32:00.196
- If Abundoramiswamy were here, he’d be so happy.
- Ma.

00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:01.342
Where is he?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.420
I don’t know.

00:32:03.031 --> 00:32:04.441
Where’s Kidlat!

00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:08.904
I don’t know.

00:32:11.967 --> 00:32:13.292
I’m going to look for him.

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:20.077
Jerome.

00:32:23.188 --> 00:32:24.534
Ma...

00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:28.360
You are a child of conflict...

00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:31.542
But I have learned to love you.

00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:36.241
Now, son, go and look
for your fellow Indigos.

00:32:43.438 --> 00:32:44.908
As for me…

00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:47.226
I’m finally free.

00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:54.929
They won’t let you go, Ma.

00:33:15.398 --> 00:33:16.804
Just like that.

00:33:18.023 --> 00:33:20.510
I let her be.

00:33:21.614 --> 00:33:25.506
After a few weeks, Dr. Medina said
the shock therapy was a big help.

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:28.495
She said in a few weeks,
Mama could go home.

00:33:29.853 --> 00:33:31.402
Just like that.

00:33:33.008 --> 00:33:36.494
After a few days,
they couldn’t find my mom.

00:33:37.199 --> 00:33:38.994
One night, she just disappeared.

00:33:40.572 --> 00:33:44.143
There was a massive brownout then.
Someone messed up the Luzon grid.

00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:47.852
The city lost power for a couple of hours.

00:33:48.923 --> 00:33:50.510
And when the lights came back,

00:33:57.047 --> 00:33:58.180
my mom was gone.

00:34:03.403 --> 00:34:04.247
Just like that.

00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:09.429
She was gone.
I couldn’t find her anymore.

00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:13.204
And so, I looked for Kidlat instead.

00:34:15.313 --> 00:34:16.973
When I found him,

00:34:17.918 --> 00:34:18.918
I confronted him.

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:22.894
I asked him if he remembers Felisa.

00:34:23.827 --> 00:34:25.452
He said he doesn’t know anyone
by that name.

00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:27.699
So I told him.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.697
I recounted to him
what he did to my mother.

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:35.519
How he hurt and destroyed her.

00:34:37.968 --> 00:34:39.236
He kept shaking his head.

00:34:39.656 --> 00:34:42.390
He insisted that he did not know Felisa.

00:34:44.327 --> 00:34:46.366
Then, I remembered.

00:34:47.576 --> 00:34:52.505
I remembered and told my father
the real name of my mother.

00:34:56.156 --> 00:34:57.745
He was stunned.

00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:03.541
I silenced this Kidlat
who was sitting in a wheelchair,

00:35:04.275 --> 00:35:07.726
His legs amputated
due to gangrene caused by diabetes.

00:35:10.472 --> 00:35:12.114
I silenced him.

00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.490
And then I told him,

00:35:17.873 --> 00:35:21.654
"Remember my mother’s name
until your last breath."

00:35:23.827 --> 00:35:27.034
Her name is Adora.
