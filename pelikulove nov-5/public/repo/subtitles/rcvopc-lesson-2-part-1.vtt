00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.952
We are now on session two.

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:17.120
The first question usually asked

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.749
by someone who wants
to write plays is

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:22.730
"What am I going to write?"

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.598
The answer is anything.

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:31.220
You can write anything,
in any form of writing.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.212
And because of that,

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.680
it becomes difficult to write

00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:42.616
because the source materials,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.372
or let's say inspiration
of a writer for a play,

00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:53.992
are as vast
as the universe

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.868
and what they know
in that “universe."

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.711
Now there are two sources
you can get from.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:15.485
Most teachers
usually recommend

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.248
to write from
personal experience

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:24.858
since it's probably
the most convenient.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:28.502
If there are no other sources,

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:30.430
then mine your own experiences.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.166
It’s almost natural to do that.

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.057
To a certain extent,

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:41.486
whether or not
you are conscious about it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.062
you will end up writing
from experience anyway.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.119
Sometimes you tend
to do that subconsciously

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:58.614
when it's based from
repressed desires or fantasies.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:05.686
Since it's you,
it's your voice and all of that.

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:09.256
So, okay personal experience, fine.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.154
But not everything
will be based from your experience

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:20.515
especially when you write
about criminals,

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.277
unless you are one.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:32.039
You can't limit yourself
from writing about other people

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.742
just because you didn't
experience their life.

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:41.619
Even the Nobel Prize winner,
Kazuo Ishiguro doesn't believe

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:46.670
that we should start writing
from personal experiences.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:54.725
It's not essential,
even for newbie writers.

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:57.535
Your source materials
could be from what you see,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.928
from your five senses,
you're aware of your surroundings.

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:05.944
Everything that stimulates
your senses

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.111
could be a source of material.

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:13.937
Even food and cooking
are source materials.

00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:18.059
What you hear from the radio, TV,
or the neighborhood are materials.

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.910
Same goes with what
you read, see, observe.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.254
Or when a film moves you.

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:27.868
Especially our preference for "pegs."

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.680
Something that looks
like this or that,

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:35.963
something like the film here
or the TV show there,

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.323
It's all possible,
why not?

00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:39.623
That's material.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.809
Something you felt,
whether emotional or physical.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:47.062
Like pain you went through.

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:48.176
It's material.

00:03:48.201 --> 00:03:56.336
Your sources for writing
can come from anywhere.

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:06.746
This is a whole gamut of sources
that you can take in.

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:13.162
That will be about 50%,
the choice of material that you-

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:15.951
50% of what you
want to write about

00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:18.835
will come from
the choice of material.

00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:24.295
The other 50% is your attitude
towards that material

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.343
because what you
want to write about

00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:32.183
will have to be shaped

00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:35.038
by how you want
to write about it.

00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:36.978
What is your take on this?

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.575
What do you want to say?

00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:46.822
You could make a play
about corruption in politics

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:50.509
and it can be
the most apolitical play ever,

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:55.477
Only because your attitude
towards it is not political at all.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.001
And vice versa.

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:03.658
You can talk about love
of two individuals

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:08.524
but at the same time
view it as a political negotiation.

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:12.862
It's the marriage
of these two things.

00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:19.578
How you visualize and interpret it
will be your material.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.718
That is your subjectivity
as a writer.

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:30.000
For me, what matters

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.298
eventually, ultimately

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.602
in the long run,

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:39.871
is your sheer understanding
of the play.

00:05:39.896 --> 00:05:48.752
Your perspective is what creates
uniqueness to your work

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.987
because you saw something
special in the material.

00:05:56.935 --> 00:06:00.871
This is what divides writers.

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:08.697
Some writers only see
drama in the world,

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.968
the depth of emotion
in every situation.

00:06:19.227 --> 00:06:22.661
Another basic way
of looking at it is

00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:26.947
some writers always see
the comedy in every situation.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.481
Even in the face of tragedy,
they still see comedy.

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.895
I co-wrote “Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral.”

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:43.927
We all know
Gregorio del Pilar is a hero.

00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:45.141
Of course he is.

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:51.001
He did such a heroic act in Tirad Pass.
But the manner of his death

00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:56.983
was, in a way, comic for me.

00:06:57.008 --> 00:07:00.921
Director Jerrold Tarog
may show it differently.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.539
It depends on the framing.

00:07:03.564 --> 00:07:07.809
That's why he said the difference between
comedy and tragedy is the framing.

00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:15.611
You can talk about death
and cry over it or laugh about it.

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:17.331
Let me tell you how he died.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.998
They were holding on
to Tirad Pass, right?

00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:26.579
And the Americans couldn’t attack

00:07:26.604 --> 00:07:29.209
because the Filipinos
had stronger defenses.

00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:32.365
Wherever they went,
Filipinos shot at them from above.

00:07:32.522 --> 00:07:34.688
Until one Filipino

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:42.589
guided the Americans
to the other mountain.

00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:43.830
Okay?

00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:45.431
So it got quiet.

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:47.616
Filipinos were cheering,
"Hurray! We won!"

00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:49.206
"They retreated already!”

00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.168
But actually, the Americans
had found another way.

00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:54.396
Now, Gregorio couldn’t see
the opponents.

00:07:54.421 --> 00:08:01.901
His comrade warned him
to be careful and to stay down

00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:05.134
because the Americans
could be up there.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.262
But he stood up.
And that’s how he was shot.

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:11.810
Now you can look at it
in a tragic way

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:15.054
but you can also look
at it in a comic way, right?

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:17.017
"Where are they?"
Boom. Dead.

00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:20.149
It was an instant death
because he was shot here.

00:08:21.278 --> 00:08:28.157
That’s an example
of how you frame.

00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:33.115
When I asked you what you
want to write about,

00:08:33.199 --> 00:08:35.013
a good take-off would be

00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:41.696
to write about something
that has an impact on you.

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.676
Now that impact,

00:08:43.713 --> 00:08:46.966
when you process it
in your mind as a writer,

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:52.560
can turn into drama,
into comedy, or into horror.

00:08:52.594 --> 00:08:55.256
or into something else.

00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:58.544
Because it’s how
you understand the situation

00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:01.724
or what you see
in the situation.

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:03.213
It could be anything.

00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:06.193
Taking the example of SAF 44, Marawi,

00:09:06.218 --> 00:09:08.009
what is the process of grief

00:09:08.558 --> 00:09:13.577
of someone whose loved
one has been killed

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.317
as opposed to someone
whose loved one died of cancer?

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:22.087
So there are different processes
of grief you'll go through.

00:09:22.336 --> 00:09:27.134
It depends on where you're coming from
in writing your material.

00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:37.817
Your fascination to write about
what's ugly in life is interesting.

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:39.999
That's a nice quote.

00:09:40.203 --> 00:09:44.068
"I write about the ugly truths of life."

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.929
The bad and the ugly are usually
what we hide in the cabinet

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.565
and what we conceal from others.

00:09:55.302 --> 00:10:00.167
Maybe Maynard's focal
point of interest

00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:02.876
is that he wants to expose them.

00:10:03.016 --> 00:10:09.077
He wants to let that ugliness out,
expose its stench.

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:15.316
Or remove the secrets
surrounding it.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:23.589
That’s the second most important
component in choosing a topic.

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:26.228
It’s almost automatic.

00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:29.877
You were moved because there's drama

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.987
or you got inspired
because it made you laugh.

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.209
Very basic.

00:10:35.665 --> 00:10:38.578
It elicited some kind
of response from you

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.866
since it created
a huge impact on you.

00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:43.195
And you realized

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.698
that the source or material

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:53.495
is timeless.

00:10:54.497 --> 00:10:56.764
Maybe it's been brewing in your mind,

00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:58.696
you kept remembering it,

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.150
or you kept coming back
to it for a week

00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:02.631
and you want to show it.

00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:05.399
You see this material
as a stage play.

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:09.180
It’s a story to be told

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:14.427
and you want
to make it into a play.

00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:22.354
Almost automatic, you'll know
what to say about the material.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.913
It may not yet be fully developed
but you feel it in your gut

00:11:31.818 --> 00:11:37.604
that you want to write it
because it’s meaningful

00:11:37.706 --> 00:11:41.514
to you, your life, or to the world

00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:46.243
or for whatever
greater reason there is.

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:49.117
I think there should
always be a greater reason

00:11:49.737 --> 00:11:51.739
because if it's just an opinion,

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:58.146
then you might easily
change your mind about it.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.901
Maybe that's why for me,

00:12:02.214 --> 00:12:07.451
the depth and scope of a play

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.840
and the layers
that make it effective,

00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:17.900
are dependent on
the strength of your truth claim.

00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:21.357
This is the truth you believe in.

00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:24.847
It’s more than an opinion.

00:12:28.046 --> 00:12:30.479
I'd like to quote Alain Badiou,

00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:38.693
from his magnificent book,
“Rhapsody for the Theater”

00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:42.832
where he stated that our democracy

00:12:42.988 --> 00:12:47.424
respects opinions
but hides the truth.

00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:55.211
It means our democracy
allows us to express our opinions freely

00:12:55.455 --> 00:12:59.661
while withholding the truth.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.684
What kind of democracy is that?

00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:03.842
This is one of the challenges.

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:06.272
Just in choosing the topic,

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.676
there are already so many options
to choose from.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.972
I think it will help you choose
if you ask yourself,

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.108
"How does this subject
impact you as a writer?"

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.708
"Is it strong enough
to write about?"

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:21.611
Then go.

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:24.921
I’m not saying you shouldn’t write it
if it’s not as impactful to you.

00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:31.796
That's just my belief.

00:13:35.721 --> 00:13:37.633
Okay, let's test it.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:46.197
I'll give you an exercise
which has four steps.

00:13:46.566 --> 00:13:52.006
If you're watching this,
don't click fast forward.

00:13:52.062 --> 00:13:56.644
It will ruin the whole concept
of the exercise.

00:13:57.713 --> 00:13:59.304
For the first step,

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:01.534
choose a topic.

00:14:03.127 --> 00:14:04.704
An issue or topic.

00:14:06.005 --> 00:14:08.724
It could be a general topic
like freedom

00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:14.347
or a specific topic
like reproductive health or divorce.

00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:24.301
Choose a topic that you think
has truly made an impact on you.

00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:31.002
A topic that you will
defend to the death

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:38.099
so that what you write
will have a strong effect

00:14:38.124 --> 00:14:42.004
and you're sure
of what you're saying.

00:14:42.118 --> 00:14:47.232
As if you're getting ready
to post a Facebook status

00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:51.035
announcing, "This is my belief."

00:14:51.114 --> 00:14:56.435
"Move aside, this is what I feel
about this topic!"

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.020
Probably, it would be helpful
if the topic is more specific.

00:15:02.073 --> 00:15:05.314
Not just love,
since that's very broad.

00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:06.630
Exactly what about it?

00:15:07.472 --> 00:15:12.672
You want to talk about it
and write a few paragraphs.

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:13.270
Prose.

00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:20.726
It's like your theses
on this particular topic.

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:25.925
Theses. T-h-e-s-e-s.
Meaning the different statements you want to say.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.504
It's like this
because it's like this and so on.

00:15:29.868 --> 00:15:33.540
I believe this because.
You don't just "think". You "believe".

00:15:33.795 --> 00:15:39.695
Here we'll figure out,
at this moment at least,

00:15:39.725 --> 00:15:47.655
the issues or topics that you value
and your insights on it.

00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:49.498
Just write it.

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:56.224
I'll give you five minutes.
That's the first step.

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:06.266
Actually, I've considered writing this
for the longest time.

00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:10.104
It's about polyamory.
"I believe in polyamory."

00:16:10.308 --> 00:16:13.546
"Not just in gay relationships."

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:19.038
"I believe it makes love
open to possibilities"

00:16:19.148 --> 00:16:24.203
"and in recognizing things
that are realistic and feasible."

00:16:24.258 --> 00:16:28.375
"When the period of romance
and sweet nothings have faded,"

00:16:28.448 --> 00:16:31.381
"it doesn't mean love has faded as well."

00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:34.742
"It could have changed shape or form,"

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:38.969
"or looking for an outlet,
but still rooted to what it calls home."

00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:43.428
"I believe in polyamory among gays"

00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:48.044
"because this kind of love
is what the community needs,"

00:16:48.126 --> 00:16:50.751
"especially if they've been
historically deprived of it."

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.223
- I love the "deprived" part.
- Love letter.

00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:57.407
Alright, next.

00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.848
My topic is about grief.

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:02.395
"So people have
different ways of grieving."

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.215
"Some people cry so easily."

00:17:04.317 --> 00:17:08.341
"Others put on a strong facade,
but cry in the privacy of their own homes,"

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.919
"in their own private moments."

00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:14.358
"Of course, that banks on the concept
that crying is a manifestation of grieving."

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:17.157
"Depending on which psychologist's page
you read it from,"

00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:19.723
"there are five
or seven stages of grief."

00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:23.048
"This is like a template
of what each person goes through"

00:17:23.073 --> 00:17:24.691
"when grieving the loss of someone."

00:17:24.716 --> 00:17:28.165
"And each person may go through
these stages at different speeds."

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:32.541
"Maybe go through all stages in one day
or maybe one year or a few years."

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.104
"And is it possibe to go through
the rest of your life grieving?"

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:39.803
"The final stage of grieving
is acceptance and/or hope."

00:17:39.894 --> 00:17:43.178
"Does one ever really get to accept
the death of a loved one?"

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.433
"Maybe what we consider as acceptance
is actually a form of nonchalance."

00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:50.153
"Surrendering to the fact
that someone's really gone."

00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:52.576
"That someone will never be
with you again."

00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:56.700
"And you will no longer be creating
memories with that one person."

00:17:56.896 --> 00:17:59.545
"And all that remains are memories
with that one person."

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.975
"Memories that fade."

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:04.908
"Memories that are soon forgotten
or clouded by self-doubt"

00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:07.822
"about the details and feelings
behind the memories."

00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:12.334
"Until the time comes that you remember
that someone less and less each day."

00:18:13.972 --> 00:18:15.649
So, what do you believe in then?

00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:17.752
It doesn't end.

00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:19.619
- The grief, it never ends?

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.874
So you will forever grieve...

00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:26.190
a part of you...?

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:31.086
- Until you don't remember anything.

00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:37.894
You mean grief ends
when forgetfulness comes in?

00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:39.780
Something like that.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.583
Until you forget,
is that what you mean?

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:48.434
- If you forget it,
then it ends, doesn't it?

00:18:50.543 --> 00:18:56.749
You never totally accept it.
It just became biological.

00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.311
Well, that's my opinion.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.120
"Should a woman
become a mother?"

00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:11.062
- Ay.

00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:14.317
- My gosh.

00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:18.510
"To ask this question
is indicative of the sexist roles"

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:20.538
"that society imposes on women."

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:23.591
"The term 'should' implies
that it is a requirement."

00:19:23.724 --> 00:19:26.006
"Some even go as far as saying
that the woman's worth"

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:28.500
"relies solely on their choice
to have a child."

00:19:28.633 --> 00:19:31.484
"When they hear a woman say
they don't want children,"

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.803
"they retort by saying,
"'You'll change your mind.""

00:19:33.828 --> 00:19:35.842
"Or you will never feel
fulfilled without them."

00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:38.803
"The fact that we shame a man
less for choosing to be a bachelor"

00:19:38.847 --> 00:19:41.653
"as compared to a woman
who chooses not to marry and raise a child"

00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:44.578
"shows that this expectation
weighs heavier on women."

00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:48.592
"At the same time, however, we should not shame
women for choosing to have children."

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:51.052
"How modern society frames
a woman becoming a mother"

00:19:51.077 --> 00:19:52.905
"has somewhat become negative."

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.866
"It seems negative for a woman
to choose to have children"

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.001
"because they are perceived
as conforming to a certain role."

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.782
"Again, this is an indication
of an unfair expectation."

00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:06.918
"Ultimately, it should not be termed
as a 'should' statement"

00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:08.410
"but as a "can" statement."

00:20:08.435 --> 00:20:11.025
"A woman can become
a mother if she chooses to."

00:20:11.194 --> 00:20:14.128
"It's not a matter of gender roles.
It is a matter of choice."

00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:16.644
"And their choice on the matter
should have no bearing"

00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:18.380
"on their identity as a woman."

00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:26.282
- I feel like a tear fell.

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:28.977
[inaudible speech]

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:33.672
So that's why her
typing was so intense.

00:20:33.697 --> 00:20:36.395
- I thought the laptop
was going to break.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.687
Alright.

00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:45.328
Almost all of your statements
have a stand, right?

00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:48.663
(To Dingdong)
I think you should also tweak it

00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:50.779
in such a way
that it becomes a stronger stand

00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:52.900
and not just
an informative one.

00:20:52.925 --> 00:20:56.049
Like, you know, we go through
this process of grieving etc.

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:58.367
What do you want
to say about grieving?

00:20:58.392 --> 00:21:01.953
What do you believe
about people who grieve?

00:21:02.101 --> 00:21:06.074
You probably had-
everyone of us had

00:21:06.173 --> 00:21:07.748
moments of grief.

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:12.817
And you believe that moment
of grief will never go away.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.620
You will never truly
accept the loss.

00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:18.827
Something like that, right?

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.554
So you already wrote
your truth claim?

00:21:25.077 --> 00:21:26.779
For the next step,

00:21:27.714 --> 00:21:33.181
all the truth claims
you mentioned earlier...

00:21:34.308 --> 00:21:35.448
you now have to destroy.

00:21:36.574 --> 00:21:39.495
It’s like a debate
and this is your rebuttal.

00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:42.828
Like if we're on Facebook,
you’re a troll.

00:21:43.558 --> 00:21:48.296
You’re going to destroy
and contradict everything you said.

00:21:50.096 --> 00:21:54.610
You need to have an argument
as strong as your first claim.

00:21:55.164 --> 00:21:59.903
Look for something
that will devastate

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.722
and completely ruin
the manifesto you wrote.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.634
It may not be
what you believe in

00:22:09.722 --> 00:22:12.341
but I want you
to do the exact opposite

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.121
with as much weight

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.894
and as much passion

00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:24.195
in terms of stating
the opposite stance.

00:22:24.253 --> 00:22:25.895
Try to convince yourself

00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:30.196
that what you said ten minutes ago
are all false claims.

00:22:31.592 --> 00:22:33.499
I’ll give you five minutes again.
