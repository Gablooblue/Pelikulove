00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:16.590
You can choose what kind of language
the character will use.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.139
You can use archaic language.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:22.749
If for example...

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.012
you want to show
how people spoke before.

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:27.995
It’s just an approximation.
It’s not entirely true

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.709
because you weren’t there at that time.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.384
They can also do
an all-out poetry.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.389
The characters you choose

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.037
will also provide
the opportunity for you

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.574
to choose how they’ll speak.

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.002
If this is realistic,
therefore,

00:00:46.284 --> 00:00:52.821
it’s important that the diction
and vocabulary you chose

00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.928
fits the situation
and where they came from.

00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:01.936
If she’s a nurse or doctor,
she talks like this

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:05.472
If she’s a janitor,
she talks like this.

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:09.170
If she’s a shoes saleslady,
she talks like this.

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:13.375
That’s for the realistic play,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.761
but it can also be sung.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:23.961
But the words you choose
add to the character.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.734
Whatever the character says

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:32.484
comes backs to her
and we get to know her more.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.125
through the way she talks,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.937
the words she uses,

00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:37.679
how she responds.

00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.311
All these add up for us

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:43.740
to know the character better.

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:45.322
And because of that

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.954
the assignment I’ll give you…

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:52.391
In session three,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.082
I showed you what characteristics

00:01:57.557 --> 00:02:01.849
you should give to your characters
based on the story.

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:04.027
You can’t separate it.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.840
For me, I can’t separate the character

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.752
from what she’s trying to achieve
or the story she’ll make.

00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:16.226
So the first assignment
is to write a character sketch.

00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:20.168
Introduce the characters to me.

00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:30.936
Include the story she’s going through
and how she’ll face it.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.231
Will she achieve it or not?

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:39.748
In the character sketch,
you can determine what she really wants,

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.755
which is called objective.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.375
What's her objective?

00:02:46.158 --> 00:02:48.923
And when she achieves it,
the story will end.

00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:50.134
Whether she achieves it or not,

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:51.722
if she dies because of it,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.080
the story ends.

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:59.172
Second, put the character
in a situation.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.340
You’ve already seen
her entire sketch.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:10.554
Let’s put the character in a situation
where we’ll hear her speak.

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:14.282
So she’ll do a monologue
in a given situation,

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:18.982
not just a monologue in front of you
or in front of the audience.

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:27.232
Let’s place her in a situation
based on the story he’ll go through.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:31.365
So that we’ll hear it.

00:03:33.263 --> 00:03:38.002
I’m not saying
you’ll include it in your play.

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:43.017
We just want to hear her
and see what she’ll do

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.612
and what her decision will be
in the problem she’s facing.

00:03:47.948 --> 00:03:50.682
When you find out what she wants,

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:59.080
one of the most important
qualities you will give

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:00.398
is her occupation

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:05.213
because that will dictate
a big part of one’s identity,

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:10.932
which is why sometimes,
to the point of stereotyping,

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.446
sometimes, when you put…

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:20.018
May Cardoso, 24, nurse.

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:22.812
Your character is a nurse.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:26.196
She entered the stage
wearing hot pants.

00:04:27.803 --> 00:04:32.343
It creates a break in expectations.

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:38.579
Normally when you see a nurse,
it’s either with a white cap or scrubs.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.195
Migy Obina, 45, banker.

00:04:43.532 --> 00:04:44.599
Wearing a gown.

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:52.785
Recently just won Miss Universe.
Oh, how’s that?

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:59.308
That’s slightly a big leap for you
to prove that he’s really a banker.

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:03.374
Otherwise, if the play is about
being a beauty queen,

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.829
she could be a beautician
for all we care

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:11.274
because his being a banker
has nothing to do with it.

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:17.457
Again, we go back to what fits
the story you want to do.

00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:21.930
You also, of course, will develop
the diction of your character.

00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:23.977
The language that she uses.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:32.940
Is she quiet like the people you know
that aren’t talkative but when they talk—

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:33.981
Boom!

00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:40.596
Her truths are very explosive

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.300
Hurtful, but she doesn’t talk often

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.582
Or is she so talkative that sometimes
she talks first before she thinks?

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.562
And then of course

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:55.147
if you put them together,

00:05:55.172 --> 00:06:00.019
your character’s occupation
can figure in with the language.

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.168
A lawyer will talk differently
from a doctor

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.660
who will talk differently
from a garbage collector,

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.592
who will talk differently
from a store owner.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.230
She has a stock of words.

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:19.036
One good example would be
the movie "Respeto."

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.273
Much of the language used is in FlipTop.

00:06:29.426 --> 00:06:32.822
And it’s really focused on the words.

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:37.613
The beauty of the words,
the rhythm of the words.

00:06:38.308 --> 00:06:43.324
Those are what can also set
the mood and the style.

00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:45.944
Do they speak in verse?

00:06:46.052 --> 00:06:47.786
It doesn’t have to be realistic.

00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:49.921
But even the choice of words!

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:56.093
Call center agents talk differently
from a witch doctor or entertainment hosts.

00:06:57.972 --> 00:07:00.437
Even the English
they use is different.

00:07:00.738 --> 00:07:06.125
All of these, the decisions they make,
the language they use,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.300
creates an illusion
of three-dimensionality.

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:13.807
This is where,
not entirely poetry,

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:17.375
but poetic devices come in
that you could use.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.916
For example, when he (Maynard's character)
said he only eats adobo and so on.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:27.867
It creates a different kind of flavor
in the way the character talks.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.313
It elicits what the character values.

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:36.063
He apparently likes adobo.
Why not sinigang?

00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:38.005
Maybe it doesn’t sound right.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:40.319
Sinigang, different
kinds of sinigang,

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.279
so sour!

00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:48.394
But adobo, if you’re adobo,
a different kind of adobo…

00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:51.825
That’s where the poetry of it comes in.

00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:55.878
What words will this character use?

00:07:56.552 --> 00:07:59.668
- For the people who speak in verse,

00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:03.497
- Is that artistic license or half-half?

00:08:03.622 --> 00:08:06.355
- Or is there a way to make it natural?

00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:14.323
It's because you are thinking, the way--

00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:20.133
Even the way you formed your question,
it’s because you’re thinking realistically

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:25.395
You think that speaking
in verse is unnatural.

00:08:26.402 --> 00:08:29.813
Anything you put on stage
is already by itself unnatural.

00:08:29.838 --> 00:08:33.447
Why would you put it
on stage if it’s natural?

00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:35.737
If you want natural,
you go out there.

00:08:35.828 --> 00:08:36.828
That's natural.

00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:41.085
Once you heighten a situation,

00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:43.657
a life story,

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:45.056
any story,

00:08:45.372 --> 00:08:49.917
once you put it on stage,
you take it out of its natural context

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.419
by putting it there.

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:53.216
So why not with words?

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:54.675
That’s all there is.

00:08:57.394 --> 00:09:02.388
When you start it that way,
and you want that overall effect,

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:05.514
then you have to be consistent.

00:09:08.294 --> 00:09:12.866
And then again, if you’re experimental,
you can break it at some point.

00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.503
At one point, it suddenly
becomes realistic.

00:09:15.557 --> 00:09:17.997
In the next scene,
why do they suddenly talk like that?

00:09:18.722 --> 00:09:23.565
Maybe you’re trying
to make a statement

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:26.799
that we need to figure out.

00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:28.428
It could be like that.

00:09:28.645 --> 00:09:29.926
It could be…

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.645
You accepted Yoda, right?

00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:34.012
Have you watched Star Wars?

00:09:34.202 --> 00:09:38.689
The sentence construction is reversed.
Grammar Nazis would go crazy.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.517
It doesn’t have to be
a human being.

00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:45.429
Isn’t it annoying when she’s already
wearing an animal mask

00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:49.906
but he talks just like a human being?
Isn’t that annoying?

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.502
It ruins the illusion.

00:09:53.696 --> 00:09:55.329
Why did you make her
wear a rat costume?

00:09:55.414 --> 00:09:58.116
You chose a style.

00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:04.677
I would like to think you chose that
because you think it’s impactful.

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.642
That’s why it’s a musical.
For example, they’re in rhyme.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.851
So whatever style of language you use,

00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:19.723
I think it’s important to be true
to the world that you’re creating.

00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:28.442
If you make it that way,
the poeticism comes out more.

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:34.023
In this monologue,
put the character you chose

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:39.562
at a point where she needs
to make a decision

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:44.087
based on what she really wants to happen.

00:10:44.969 --> 00:10:48.946
It can be first decion-making,
final decision-making,

00:10:48.987 --> 00:10:50.787
or middle decision-making.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:55.126
A character does many decisions
to achieve what she wants.

00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:59.063
Just choose one part
where she’ll do a monologue.

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:00.967
Character sketch.

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:02.432
Monologue.

00:11:03.175 --> 00:11:08.584
And then let’s see if you’ll create
an interesting character.
