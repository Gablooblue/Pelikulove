00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.351
How about you, Maynard--

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:15.979
That's my question as well.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:21.311
How does the dynamic change
between the writer and director or with the actors

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:26.431
when the playwright
is a beginner or more established?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.775
For example,

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:32.620
when I read texts written
by older writers,

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:34.580
it's very rich.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:37.511
Older.
Ouch!

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:39.881
You didn't even hold back.

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.097
If I understand you correctly,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:47.382
this is where power
relations come in.

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:50.781
That sometimes happens
in Virgin Labfest.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.683
The wide-eyed playwright gets accepted
in the festival and is super thrilled

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:58.680
and then you hand her over
to a well-known director,

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.635
you know,
whatever he says will be...

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.051
he'll end up reversing
the process.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.524
Suddenly, the playwright
is blinded by the vision.

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:16.315
She'll adopt the director's vision
because the director is well-known.

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.712
It's almost like breathing
behind your neck.

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:19.974
Or reverse.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.216
Let's say there's a young director
and then there's an established playwright.

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:27.103
How will you negotiate?

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.302
One answer is having a contract
from the beginning.

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:34.554
Not the kind you're thinking,
but a social contract.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.385
Have some coffee first.

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:39.406
A social contract is clear to me.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.273
When I started out as a director,

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.729
it was clear I'd mess with the script.

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:48.975
I mean that's clear

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:52.167
or I say it outright to playwrights,
"I'll stand by your script to the death."

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:53.875
That's my pact here.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.133
But there were materials
where I was asked to be the director

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:01.880
because they knew
my ethics and ways of making.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.573
There are those instances.

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:08.746
They offer this material
because they know your working conditions.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.441
They know how you work.

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:15.067
I think it's important to have
a clear talk from the get-go.

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.947
But it's really quite difficult
for a young director,

00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:19.474
how she can play with the script.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.699
Let's not stage it,
if worst comes to worst.

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:24.800
But you could still negotiate.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:30.367
I think that's how it is for directors
who get starstruck with veteran writers.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.866
While there are others
who'll just hand it over and say "Go,"

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.145
"Go ahead, play with it."

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.841
"You might bring
a different resonance to the material."

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.100
So there's trust.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.839
There are those who'll say,
"It's just like this."

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:44.262
I'm like, "What is this, a canon?"
Then so be it.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:47.115
As a director,
I'm also the medium.

00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:50.942
I make the connection
however old the material is.

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:56.233
I read not just the piece,
but the context of the times, of when it's being staged.

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.916
The meaning-making's
on a different level.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.358
I don't know if I answered the question.

00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:04.535
But there's that
sort of awareness to it.

00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.695
At least when you're
working as a director.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.776
A clear discussion is important.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.466
Like, "Hey, I'm sorry,
I'll be chopping your material."

00:03:14.502 --> 00:03:16.922
The match is also very important.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:21.597
It’s a match from the beginning
so that match has to be made.

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:25.261
Meaning, "Is this the right director
for this material?"

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.592
"Is this the appropriate playwright
for this director?"

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:30.451
That's one.
Second is the context.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:35.737
The context of Virgin Labfest
for developing writers is different

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.843
and the context
for Tanghalang Pilipino or PETA

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:42.430
employing professional
staging is different.

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:48.699
I think Virgin Labfest
is a safer environment for writers

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:52.937
because the premise
is this is a playwrights' festival,

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:54.392
not a directors' festival.

00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:57.356
It’s not about the director
trying to show off

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.503
his interpretation or prowess.

00:03:59.558 --> 00:04:02.691
- It's not?
- The director is a vehicle for communication.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:05.125
For me, as young playwrights,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.708
I think you should try
working with all kinds of directors.

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:10.736
I think it'll make you richer
because you worked with

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:16.103
a really crazy, overbearing director
and then someone that’s cool to work with.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.146
Because you’re young
that’s the time to get into trouble.

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:23.185
You know what doesn't kill you
will make you strong

00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:26.439
so that's also
part of the experience.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.625
It’s exchanging ideas
with different types of directors.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.565
So try them.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.229
If you don’t like them,
don’t work with them again.

00:04:36.254 --> 00:04:38.265
Like what you said, finding the right fit.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.911
Or maybe you’ll get along in the future.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.537
I feel lucky because
we have playwrights in PETA.

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:47.889
Primarily, I’ve worked
with Rody and Liza (Magtoto).

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:49.741
And ‘cause we’ve known
each other for a long time,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.797
it's not that difficult.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:56.564
Reaching version 8--
Liza was like that before.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:57.997
Let's start going there.

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:01.352
I'll ask you to cite
specific examples.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.734
Good, bad.

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:05.686
So we can at least
see how it's like.

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:10.735
In terms of processing, for me,
because we're on a commission-basis,

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.048
there’s really a time
like 6 months to a year.

00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:19.259
So from the first draft,
we read it several times with groups.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.391
By the time we get
to the working draft,

00:05:21.646 --> 00:05:23.991
I personally don’t expect
my writer to be there for awhile

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:27.533
because I feel like
we've already discussed it, threshed it out.

00:05:27.558 --> 00:05:29.650
I already agreed
that this is the working draft.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.392
I'll take it from here.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.601
And then give me time maybe 10 days
to 2 weeks ‘til I shape something.

00:05:36.762 --> 00:05:39.089
And then I come
and ask you to watch.

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:40.922
Or in the process,

00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:44.791
if I tweak something along the way
or move things a bit,

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.970
I have the writers informed
of what’s happening.

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:51.141
But I really don’t expect them
to be with me in the room

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.757
once I get the working draft.

00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:54.446
How about you, Maynard?

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:56.858
You're always there
during rehearsal, right?

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:58.311
Every day?

00:05:58.407 --> 00:06:00.560
I mean every step of the way.

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:04.317
But you don’t threaten
the director or anything.

00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:06.336
He didn't threaten me.

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:10.096
There are people like that.

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:12.937
When I work
with foreign writers,

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.088
the text is theirs,
while I focus on the context.

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:18.859
- Of course, I'm the one on-the-ground.
- That's nice.

00:06:18.884 --> 00:06:21.338
The text is yours,
but the context is mine, okay?

00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:24.524
So it being Filipinized
won't be a problem.

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:27.451
It's mine to take care of.
Let me handle it.

00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:33.580
As for Maynard,
every time the playwright is at rehearsals,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.711
I see it as an opportunity to fail.

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.576
Every rehearsal
is an opportunity to fail fast.

00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.891
Let's fail right now.

00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:43.832
Let's be accountable
for what doesn't work and change it.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.044
So it's usually okay
for the playwright to be there.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.254
But there are those
who'll really leave you to it.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.678
Then leave it up to you.
There're people like that.

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.843
So when you fail,
it's all on you.

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.815
That's why in the past,
I start with saying,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.573
“Okay, game, let's break a leg!"
"Acting, we'll take responsibility, we'll direct it.”

00:07:02.598 --> 00:07:05.728
And if the text doesn't really work,
you'll hear it.

00:07:05.753 --> 00:07:10.164
And the audience knows
because everyone's giving it their all.

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:13.266
Like “Wow, something amazing happened!"
"But what does it mean?”

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.777
But theater rules
usually say it's the director's fault.

00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:21.617
If it isn't good,
it's because of the director.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:23.739
If it's good,
it's because of the writer.

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:27.833
But there are really times
when you can hear the script,

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:29.387
even the audience can hear it,

00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:33.316
because I think the play-watching
audience has been cultivated.

00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.570
They can sense
if there's something wrong.

00:07:35.717 --> 00:07:39.420
Sometimes I do this
when I don't get along with the playwright.

00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:41.374
I'll stand by this
even if I don't know what it means

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.440
because you're not talking to me.

00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:45.539
But it will appear
on the text no matter what.

00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:49.409
You'll see it if the collaboration's off.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:53.795
Of course, that's a bad practice
so it's encouraged that we talk.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.370
If we can't see each other, go.
But don't just leave it all behind.

00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:02.110
Actually, it's the same for me.

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:06.111
I like having the playwright around,
especially when we have questions.

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.729
But not all the time of course.

00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:11.886
Sometimes you have co-actors
who badger the playwright

00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:13.593
even if they've just arrived.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.231
"What about this line..."

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.697
It's crazy how
they ask about everything.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.037
What a pity for the writer.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:25.102
We should be exploring.

00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:31.210
We should explore things
according to how we understand it.

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:35.648
That's when we should ask
if that's what the writer had in mind.

00:08:35.673 --> 00:08:39.644
Or is it along the lines, at least,
of your vision for the play.

00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.226
Because if she gives it all away...

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.284
I think as a young playwright
or emerging playwright,

00:08:50.327 --> 00:08:52.139
one of the learnings,
looking back,

00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:53.783
is if you're a beginning playwright,

00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:56.310
make sure that you work
with an experienced director.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.110
If you're a beginning playwright
with a fledgling director,

00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:01.996
you might think up
all sorts of things.

00:09:02.021 --> 00:09:05.261
Good luck with the direction
of your material.

00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:08.530
That's also fun.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:12.984
Remember “Barrio Cordillera”?

00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:17.093
That was our first collaboration.

00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:20.306
You have to have
those moments.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.228
Nowadays,
I have a reverse experience.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:29.356
There's an amateur group
asking for rights to stage "Buwan at Baril"

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.014
so I gave them free rights.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.179
I told them to mount it
because I was thrilled they liked it.

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.719
When it came back to me,

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:42.810
they already had a
description of the show.

00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:45.540
And they devised "Buwan at Baril".

00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:48.165
So I asked them if they knew
the meaning of a devised work.

00:09:48.253 --> 00:09:49.920
Did it become pro-Marcos?

00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:59.122
I asked them that,
the meaning of "devised".

00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:03.320
Sometimes using the term "devised"
is an abuse,

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:06.180
an excuse for doing whatever.

00:10:06.853 --> 00:10:08.586
- I don't know what it is.

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:10.031
Exactly.

00:10:10.636 --> 00:10:12.811
Theater in the route
but they'll call it "site-specific".

00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:14.103
It's not like that.

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:16.585
They call it "site-specific".

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.655
It's our fault.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.924
But not all alternative
space is a site-specific.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.819
When you're in a bar, it's a bar.

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:29.766
When you're in a bar,
and you do a fourth wall, it's kinda funny.

00:10:31.584 --> 00:10:35.957
Theater has a history
and we should know it

00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:37.332
even writers and actors.

00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:40.092
What's scary is I don't know
how it's going to play out.

00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:41.805
I asked the meaning of "devised".

00:10:41.853 --> 00:10:43.907
They replied with,
"We'll show the maid."

00:10:43.932 --> 00:10:45.748
But the maid was invisible in the original.

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:56.523
What? You'll show the maid?
But the point was she's invisible.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.351
That's what I'm saying.

00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.746
If you’re a young playwright
working with a director,

00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:07.903
make sure the director
at least knows his tools,

00:11:07.943 --> 00:11:09.874
knows what he’s talking about.

00:11:09.938 --> 00:11:13.958
If he’s talking about devised work,
he needs to know what it means.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.073
Not just something he says.

00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:20.228
Most of the time, these things
become trendy so quickly.

00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:23.465
But they actually don't know
what it means and how it plays out.

00:11:23.632 --> 00:11:26.663
I'll add to that.
Like the idea of experimentation,

00:11:26.704 --> 00:11:29.439
experimenting
with playwrights and writers.

00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:33.053
People often mistake experimentation
as something without rigor.

00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:35.799
That it's just your
run-of-the-mill thing.

00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:37.355
But it's not like that.

00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:40.685
That’s why you have to bring
the right people on board.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.539
If the director's not experienced,
at least get some actors who're sharp

00:11:45.564 --> 00:11:47.667
and can dissect the script.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.651
If it becomes the problem of a playwright,
how to make the actors act,

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:54.017
and the director
doesn't know a thing as well,

00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:55.334
then it'll be difficult

00:11:55.744 --> 00:11:58.686
because you won't be able to
give life to the characters.

00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:02.218
Another abused term
is "out of the box".

00:12:02.849 --> 00:12:04.489
This is what I always say,

00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:06.862
you have to understand
what the box is first!

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:08.650
Before you go out of the box.

00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:10.623
How can you claim
it's out of the box--

00:12:10.623 --> 00:12:15.040
It was never from the box
in the first place.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.413
What I’m saying is,

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:19.837
know the rules first
before you break one.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.360
Because how will you say
you broke the rules,

00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:25.991
when you don't know
the rules to begin with.
