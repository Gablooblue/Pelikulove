00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.880
Now let me first clarify

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:21.619
that there could be many
various sources for plays.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.746
Like what I said,

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.956
we could get fascinated with a topic
or with a news item, whatever.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.408
It could also begin

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:34.385
with a fascination
for a certain character

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:40.747
and that’s what you
developed into a story,

00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:46.201
made a sketch of,
set the tone for, and so on.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.107
Another way is starting
with the genre.

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:56.062
You thought of creating a musical

00:00:57.086 --> 00:01:01.557
or horror play, which only a few
can effectively pull off in theaters

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:08.522
because obviously it really needs
some kind of technical wizardry

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.386
to get the effect you want.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.030
Or you can also stick
to the traditional.

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:23.041
But in this session,

00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:27.599
I want to show you
or want you to know

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.070
that the whole tradition
of Philippine theater is vast,

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:39.398
even if our tradition
may not be as old

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:43.855
as Europe or Greece
or any other country.

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:46.731
When we say theater,

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:56.729
we mean theater that is developed
and written by playwrights, by dramatists.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:03.583
We won’t include
the rituals and folk traditions.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.758
In the Philippines,

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:11.997
we can divide it into two.

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:15.426
It can be categorized

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:20.638
into traditional theater
and modern theater.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:23.607
Traditional theater still exists today

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:28.067
and is still prevalent
wherever you go in the country.

00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:32.572
The tradition to stage
passion plays during Holy Week,

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:38.325
the tradition of <i>panunuluyan</i>,
all the religious plays and playlets,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.779
and performance practices
are still widespread.

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:51.368
Even today, comedies and <i>sarsuwelas</i>
are still staged on theaters.

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:56.693
Of course, these all developed
and some have done studies about these forms.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.549
It’s good for you to know

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:04.521
the history of theater
in the Philippines,

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:09.618
which playwrights took part in.

00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:13.836
The history of theater in the Philippines

00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.482
faced a lot of obstacles.

00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:17.952
What I always take note of

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:22.858
is that there’s a particular divide.

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:25.883
It’s not a very hostile divide.

00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:30.581
Except that in the practice

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:35.224
of traditional theater
and modern contemporary theater,

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:37.478
sometimes it overlaps,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:41.286
but it’s not that big.

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:45.857
When I say the traditional
theater practice,

00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:50.369
I don’t only mean the writing of it,
I don’t only mean the aesthetic of it.

00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:52.443
But also the organizing of it.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:58.784
I’m talking about the still existing
passion play, comedy,

00:03:59.097 --> 00:04:01.882
and all the other theater forms

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:04.932
taught by Nic Tiongson

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.745
on his survey of Philippine theater.

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:10.372
They still do exist.

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:14.349
While the roots come from
the Spanish era and the American era,

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:18.594
you can still see it
in the provinces.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:22.551
It’s a community event
that people in the community expect

00:04:24.344 --> 00:04:26.760
as part of the whole festivity.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.549
It’s actually closer to a ritual,

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:34.955
as if “It’s not a festival without it.”

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:40.163
The Holy Week experience
is incomplete

00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:45.575
if you don’t watch how Jesus
marched and died on the cross.

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:48.664
You need to watch
the Passion of Christ.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:51.722
It’s tradition,

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:56.318
and the system is relatively closed.

00:04:57.051 --> 00:05:01.935
I haven’t heard anyone

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.769
promoting these

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:08.579
on social media
or advertising these for tickets.

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:10.024
It’s not on TicketWorld.

00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:16.624
You only know that it exists,
and if you go there, it’s still there.

00:05:18.168 --> 00:05:19.255
That’s the whole thing.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.646
It’s a system on its own,
it’s a theater practice on its own.

00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:28.099
And it’s thriving.

00:05:28.622 --> 00:05:33.831
The other category is modern theater,

00:05:33.856 --> 00:05:44.552
which isn't dependent on the calendar,
like the religious calendar or festivals.

00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:51.590
And it’s not the repetitive kind of play.

00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:54.664
In modern theater,

00:05:54.861 --> 00:06:03.678
there’s an effect or influence of,
let’s say, economy.

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:07.764
You need to sell it,
you need to market it,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.467
you need to advertise it
to have an audience.

00:06:12.584 --> 00:06:15.723
It may be a simple advertisement
of you whispering to people

00:06:15.748 --> 00:06:18.490
or inviting everyone via Facebook.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.774
The market has become
more important.

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:32.766
The community or what we call
audience that we develop is more important

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:37.875
because it’s dependent
on ticket sales and so on.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.337
Although, relatively, that practice
is still not that entrenched

00:06:42.362 --> 00:06:46.318
because most of the
contemporary theater companies

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:52.240
are still relying
on schools as audience.

00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.833
And when you say
school as audience,

00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:58.004
there’s a hint

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:00.629
that you’re a patron

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:02.791
since you’ll have to
convince the principal

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:07.415
to require their students
to watch by bus loads.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.324
When people hear there’s a good play,
they anticipate it.

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:17.490
That’s the ideal condition.

00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:19.810
The theater thrives

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.820
because of the constant support
of the customer base.

00:07:25.096 --> 00:07:34.712
That’s why some theater companies
change their priorities.

00:07:36.362 --> 00:07:38.953
For example, 
in programming their season,

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.070
there has to be a musical
because your show might flop.

00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:46.282
Just showing straight plays might not sell.

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:52.575
So there’s a clash right?

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:57.173
It’s difficult to sell straight plays
because it’s dialogue-heavy,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.426
especially if there are
only two characters.

00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:01.866
How will you be able to sell it?

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.125
That’s why we hire famous actors.

00:08:06.783 --> 00:08:09.172
There are constraints
you’ll have to consider,

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:13.068
how to put your play on stage.

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:19.852
These are the practical things
that you also have to face.

00:08:21.144 --> 00:08:27.562
Second, most of the topics
are usually the writers' concerns.

00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:28.668
That’s you.

00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:31.981
If you want to write a new play.

00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:38.140
There’s also an area,
another layer of contemporary theater

00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:43.433
where you are able to experiment

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:47.654
or push the limits away

00:08:48.113 --> 00:08:52.248
from the demands of market forces

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:57.178
and from the audience’s expectations.

00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.310
Most of the time,

00:08:59.428 --> 00:09:02.997
I think this is the more exciting arena

00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:04.915
especially for playwrights.

00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:05.554
Why?

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:10.123
Because they’re able
to create other forms,

00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:14.512
you aren’t constrained
to just musicals,

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.813
you aren't constrained to just

00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:22.240
hiring known actors only.

00:09:24.124 --> 00:09:29.973
I guess it would be the same...

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.884
mentality of the so-called
indie film community.

00:09:39.314 --> 00:09:47.295
There’s a space for that
in contemporary Philippine theater.

00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:51.832
I guess, that’s one of
the things we encourage

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:58.385
because it breaks new ground,
style-wise, form-wise, and so on.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.070
And then when it hits,
it gets picked up

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:07.583
by the more commercially-oriented
theater companies,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.730
because it became a hit.

00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:17.872
I’m not saying that when it’s modern
it shouldn’t use the traditional form.

00:10:17.897 --> 00:10:22.461
In fact, there was a time
when modern playwrights

00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:28.418
used the elements
of traditional forms.

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:32.997
They had new interpretations
of the <i>sarsuwela</i>, passion play, and <i>panunuluyan</i>.

00:10:33.022 --> 00:10:44.427
For example, Aurelio Tolentino
wrote a new interpretation of Christ.

00:10:45.057 --> 00:10:48.157
These are the different ways

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.981
of how playwrights do it
here in the Philippines.

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:58.623
And the modern tradition still exists

00:10:59.213 --> 00:11:10.018
 despite the growth of the traditional,
for example, in the field of cinema,

00:11:10.298 --> 00:11:15.491
which is often compared to theater.

00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:20.922
You can start there.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.470
You want to produce a musical
because you’re a performer, and so on.

00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:33.746
Or you could produce
a play without songs

00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:40.245
where there’s just a situation
where the characters simply talk.

00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:43.917
It’s okay whatever genre you choose.

00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:46.793
That’s one category.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:54.097
There’s a huge effect
if you have a variety of options

00:11:54.122 --> 00:12:00.530
of different plays
that you can read or watch.
