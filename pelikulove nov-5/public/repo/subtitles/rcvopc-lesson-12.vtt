1
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.235
Everyone's read the script, right?

2
00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:20.515
-Yeah.
- Okay.

3
00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:23.781
So let’s start the discussion.

4
00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:25.445
- I have a question.

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.565
Why did you choose that
as the tone of the play?

6
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:29.746
I'm just curious.

7
00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:36.681
It’s like a period piece
with a mix of your previous character Mauro.

8
00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:37.642
- Why--

9
00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.058
- With a hint of gayness?

10
00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:39.901
- Yeah.

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.187
- A hint of gayness, really.

12
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:48.366
- The theme is serious.

13
00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:52.365
If you notice, it’s very me,
very melodramatic.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.817
I've always been melodramatic.

15
00:00:55.323 --> 00:00:57.697
Then I added a bit of Mauro's character

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.184
to diffuse the drama.

17
00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.123
However, Mauro will
become the reflection of,

18
00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:07.692
the voice of the people.

19
00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:13.841
- Your intention here, for example--

20
00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:18.162
Would you want the audience
to really feel for the character

21
00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:19.350
or have a commentary?

22
00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.663
It's like a melodrama, right?

23
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:24.148
What's your view on that?

24
00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:26.316
- First and foremost,

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.507
the objective was really to...

26
00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:32.337
tell the audience that,

27
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.523
as cliché as it may sound,

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.935
love hits everyone.

29
00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:39.483
Whatever your profession,

30
00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:40.712
whatever your vocation,

31
00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.284
when it hits you,
it hits you.

32
00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:43.564
You can't escape from it.

33
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.131
However,
at the end of the day,

34
00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:47.061
however hard it hits you,

35
00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:48.888
you can decide what to do.

36
00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:50.690
Ignore it, embrace it,

37
00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:57.799
it’s always the idea
 that people will always have a choice.

38
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.526
My first question was,

39
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.303
“Just because he’s a priest,
can’t he love anymore?”

40
00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.439
He can, he’s human.

41
00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:07.166
“Just because you're married,
you can’t love someone else anymore?”

42
00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.932
You can, ‘cause you're just human.

43
00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:10.837
Except at the end of the day,

44
00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:12.919
when you take into consideration

45
00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:18.250
the discussion
of morality and societal norms,

46
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.075
you have to choose.

47
00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:24.956
Because, sometimes,
it may be acceptable to us,

48
00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.205
but there are consequences

49
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.487
which we want to avoid.

50
00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:30.612
Secondly,

51
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:36.150
I wanted to come up with a play

52
00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:41.375
that could spark discourse about the...

53
00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:45.873
I don't know if this
is the right word

54
00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:51.405
but the conspiracy of the church
and the state or the ruling elite.

55
00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:53.992
These two institutions are huge

56
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.928
and there’s a lot
that’s happening within,

57
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:03.814
but even if people see it,

58
00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.032
they choose to ignore it.

59
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.567
"Oh but since it's the church,
it won't ever make mistakes."

60
00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:12.946
"No, it's the government.
They won't ever make mistakes."

61
00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:15.085
They turn a blind eye.

62
00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:16.278
We chose to--

63
00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:21.886
People choose to be quiet,
to be mum about it,

64
00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:25.403
even if what they’re doing
is already obvious.

65
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.872
I also want to emphasize

66
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.294
the fact that we have
a lot of commentary

67
00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:36.501
on other people’s lives,

68
00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:39.575
but we don't bother enough
with our own lives.

69
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.309
We can gossip about a priest
who's in love with a woman

70
00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:47.910
or a priest in love with a man.

71
00:03:47.982 --> 00:03:51.395
But our flaws as humans

72
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:55.450
is that we don’t pay
enough attention to our own homes

73
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.853
and we forcefully cover it up
by focusing on other people’s stories.

74
00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.268
- I would just like to add
 to what J-mee said.

75
00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:06.463
When I was reading this, it felt like,

76
00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:10.219
although I haven’t read sarsuwelas,
but I’m getting that kind of vibe.

77
00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:12.359
Like it's coming from that tradition.

78
00:04:12.594 --> 00:04:14.438
But while reading Mauro,

79
00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:15.795
it feels like he’s the only one
who’s trying to break free

80
00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:17.884
from the tradition of that genre.

81
00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:25.968
It’s usually for comic relief,

82
00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:33.363
but this is my first time
 to encounter this kind of character.

83
00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:39.505
Why did you choose to make Mauro

84
00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:42.898
different from the rest
of the characters?

85
00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:44.940
It's like they're all period characters

86
00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:47.559
and Mauro's from the present.

87
00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.881
While I was writing the play,

88
00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:01.989
I was thinking that Mauro
was invisible to them.

89
00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:05.243
That was my take on Mauro.

90
00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:10.191
While writing, I was thinking,
well here they can see Mauro,

91
00:05:10.252 --> 00:05:12.032
but at the back of my mind,

92
00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:15.420
what if Mauro
is an invisible person

93
00:05:15.454 --> 00:05:18.909
who gives commentaries
on what’s happening.

94
00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.591
They don't hear him

95
00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:23.290
but they can still
interact with him.

96
00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:34.787
I though of including
Mauro as a character

97
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:41.528
because I want him
to be the one who'll open

98
00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:48.414
the audience’s mindset 
and consciousness.

99
00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.090
He’ll act as the vessel

100
00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:56.577
for whatever the characters
want to say or explain, but can’t.

101
00:05:58.373 --> 00:06:04.184
He’ll be the one to unearth
the inner demons of the community.

102
00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:10.292
It’s like in commedia dell'arte,
you think he’s the fool

103
00:06:10.317 --> 00:06:13.015
but he's actually the wise one.

104
00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.774
- I hope you could've
maximized him in the last part.

105
00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:20.835
In the beginning,
he was very active,

106
00:06:21.913 --> 00:06:26.207
but in terms of resolving the three—

107
00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:30.075
how will he be
instrumental in all of this.

108
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.111
- I'm not sure how--
- In the resolution?

109
00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:35.517
I’m not sure how he’ll help.

110
00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:39.244
Given the very
melodramatic form,

111
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.007
since it’s like a soap opera,

112
00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:48.316
viewers are aware of this kind of format.

113
00:06:48.378 --> 00:06:52.248
Usually, they know or anticipate
what's going to happen

114
00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:54.153
because they're familiar
with the form.

115
00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:56.797
How will you push it further

116
00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:58.656
while not making it campy?

117
00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:05.672
You already used Mauro to diffuse

118
00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.407
the melodrama.

119
00:07:07.456 --> 00:07:14.222
How will you push, 
not break, the drama,

120
00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:16.126
the plot itself?

121
00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:20.243
There are shootouts,
some rivalry and so on.

122
00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.225
How you developed it was good.

123
00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:28.209
We thought Fr. Victor and Sarah
would end up together but they didn't.

124
00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.778
How will you push it further?

125
00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:33.546
When the audience is watching,

126
00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:35.499
they already have expectations.

127
00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:37.867
"They're going to beat her up.
Or rape her. I bet they raped her."

128
00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:39.401
Aren't the audience like that?

129
00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:41.182
How are you going to push it?

130
00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:43.940
Where we'll see 
unexpected twists or add-ons.

131
00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:48.326
Something like challenging
the melodrama genre.

132
00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:54.303
I'm thinking of how to make it 
unpredictable or how do you...

133
00:07:54.718 --> 00:07:57.080
I don't know
if it's with the lines or plot.

134
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:01.249
In the latter part of the story,

135
00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:05.383
after this part,

136
00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:08.891
after the town and the spiel,
until they get to the house,

137
00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:16.126
where Jaime and Sarah
went home fighting.

138
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:21.448
I was laughing at the exercise
this morning with May's case,

139
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.980
how the scene led to miscarriage.

140
00:08:25.018 --> 00:08:27.073
The same thing
happened here.

141
00:08:27.112 --> 00:08:32.076
There was pushing and pulling

142
00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.121
until there was bleeding.

143
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.119
And because of that incident,

144
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.645
since Fr. Victor already knew
the child was his,

145
00:08:41.964 --> 00:08:43.323
he said,

146
00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:45.882
"God!"

147
00:08:46.852 --> 00:08:50.145
"If I were to choose right now,
I'd rather my child live"

148
00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:51.990
"and let my love go."

149
00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:56.420
"I'll continue serving
as a priest for the rest of my life."

150
00:08:56.527 --> 00:09:00.334
On the other hand,
on Jaime's side,

151
00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:03.036
"Wait, I loved her."

152
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.656
"I'm not a vulgar person,
I loved this woman."

153
00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:10.297
There was a scene
where they prayed together

154
00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:12.571
and he said,
"Just let my wife and child live."

155
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.136
"And I'll let her go."

156
00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:19.362
Both of them
were ready to let her go.

157
00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:22.363
And it's up to Sarah to decide
what she wants to do.

158
00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:25.151
Whether she wants to go
with the priest or not.

159
00:09:25.383 --> 00:09:30.707
Until she had a talk with the maid
 and realized, "No,"

160
00:09:31.301 --> 00:09:32.655
"I'll stay with Jaime."

161
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:33.970
"He's my husband."

162
00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:37.960
"I'll stay with him."

163
00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:40.095
She's (Direk Ellen) surprised.

164
00:09:40.428 --> 00:09:43.451
- She disagrees.
- She doesn't like it.

165
00:09:46.162 --> 00:09:50.293
Sarah chose to stay
with her husband.

166
00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:56.250
Because in the dialogue
I wrote at the latter part of the story,

167
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:58.426
she was loved.

168
00:09:58.498 --> 00:09:59.410
He loved her.

169
00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:01.645
The way in which--

170
00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:04.721
Because of Jaime's
overflowing love for her,

171
00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:06.424
Jaime could've been
too drunk on love

172
00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:07.876
that's why he raped her.

173
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:12.792
- In short, the way
 he loves has always been very rough.

174
00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:17.572
Are you familiar
with the kind of love that--

175
00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:23.298
Or he just thought he loved her.
Maybe so.

176
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.762
And justified his wrongdoings
in the name of love--

177
00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:35.026
- Do you want to redeem Jaime?

178
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:41.193
- Because it could end
 with the systemic problem

179
00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:45.172
of women succumbing to societal norms.

180
00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:48.336
Based on your draft,

181
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.116
you kind of redeemed him.

182
00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:54.006
That could be one thing,
I'm not sure.

183
00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:58.017
In the beginning,
you had stock characters.

184
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.144
The evil politician, the good priest,
that was how you started, right?

185
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:08.641
Maybe you could challenge
how they're described.

186
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.909
Like a way for the characters
to justify themselves

187
00:11:10.987 --> 00:11:12.823
and make you think
they actually have a point.

188
00:11:12.848 --> 00:11:16.505
You could play with that
to change the stock characters.

189
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.687
Like apologizing after
a drunken, violent stupor.

190
00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:25.050
Apologizing after slapping her,
things like that.

191
00:11:25.097 --> 00:11:30.892
- Like he's crazy, but--
- He's actually a good person.

192
00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:35.669
I don't know, just to...
but he's still not a good person.

193
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.420
He needs help.

194
00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:42.512
I think the problem
that’s beginning to appear

195
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:46.284
is that the character changes

196
00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:51.237
according to
the situation of the scene.

197
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:55.971
You started with the impression

198
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.252
that the mayor is incompetent.

199
00:12:00.651 --> 00:12:05.068
The city is chaotic,
land disputes are rampant.

200
00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:09.119
The impression was
 that the mayor is corrupt.

201
00:12:09.973 --> 00:12:14.128
But all of a sudden
 at the end of the play, he says he is not

202
00:12:14.675 --> 00:12:17.137
and we’re supposed
to believe him.

203
00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:21.191
Because...

204
00:12:21.484 --> 00:12:25.424
For some weird logic,

205
00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:30.882
he let his wife go.

206
00:12:30.963 --> 00:12:32.388
And that act,

207
00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:38.270
which is an act of sacrifice
and an act of surrender,

208
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.377
may seem to have absolved

209
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:45.065
all the bad things he has done

210
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:47.560
in about 80% of the play.

211
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:48.878
Something like that

212
00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:52.051
I think it all started there.

213
00:12:55.167 --> 00:13:00.574
It seems like the
 whole situation was reversed.

214
00:13:00.707 --> 00:13:03.470
You made Sarah look like

215
00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:04.977
she ran to the priest,

216
00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:07.450
but this priest already
made a vow to the Lord

217
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:12.732
that he'd let go of Sarah
in exchange for the baby's life

218
00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:17.730
and that he's true to his words
and will fulfill his promise.

219
00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:21.816
Sarah suddenly feels left out

220
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:25.730
so she goes back to the man,

221
00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:29.934
to Jaime, who gladly accepts her.

222
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.851
I think, I feel that

223
00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.996
you got cornered as a writer.

224
00:13:41.739 --> 00:13:43.668
The ending is beautiful--

225
00:13:43.805 --> 00:13:47.367
the child is there,
the priest is there,

226
00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:50.583
they're all there, but they know
the child is the priest's.

227
00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:53.145
And the child is being
cared for by a family.

228
00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:58.004
That's the story
you envisioned, right?

229
00:13:58.147 --> 00:14:00.566
But how it got there,

230
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:05.539
you, I think, were forced
or compelled

231
00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:09.927
to change the definition
of your characters.

232
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.362
Jaime suddenly became

233
00:14:14.628 --> 00:14:17.336
kind and no longer corrupt.

234
00:14:17.473 --> 00:14:21.540
But Mauro continuously asserts

235
00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:26.962
that this whole
dynasty of politicians,

236
00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:32.767
of which Jaime
is the shining example,

237
00:14:32.965 --> 00:14:34.360
is really corrupt.

238
00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:37.001
And their wealth is
a product of land disputes

239
00:14:37.038 --> 00:14:41.554
and of their refusal to
provide the people

240
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:45.696
the service they are entitled to.

241
00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:52.218
The whole situation
becomes contradictory.

242
00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:55.656
He was raping his own wife,

243
00:14:56.234 --> 00:15:02.500
he was pointing guns
inside the church,

244
00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:05.103
nobody would even
think of doing that.

245
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:08.467
The impunity given
 to the character is so high

246
00:15:09.834 --> 00:15:12.927
that you had to redeem everything

247
00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:18.642
in one scene
just to get to the ending.

248
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.370
It might be that
right from the start,

249
00:15:24.395 --> 00:15:27.614
you have to rewrite Jaime

250
00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:29.607
if you want

251
00:15:30.214 --> 00:15:35.057
to get to that ending you want.

252
00:15:37.923 --> 00:15:42.618
The ending is beautiful,
the final image.

253
00:15:42.758 --> 00:15:48.117
But how it got there
doesn't convince me yet.

254
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.803
Because it seemed like Sarah,

255
00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:57.180
when she got rejected
by the one she loves,

256
00:15:57.302 --> 00:15:59.407
suddenly went back
to the one she doesn’t love.

257
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:05.758
Why can’t she be alone?

258
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.312
- In the story,

259
00:16:09.527 --> 00:16:11.711
Sarah doesn’t know

260
00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:15.878
what happened
with Fr. Victor and Jaime.

261
00:16:15.969 --> 00:16:17.730
She made
that decision herself.

262
00:16:17.887 --> 00:16:24.128
Yeah, but that
makes her look like...

263
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:27.417
some kind of opportunist.

264
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:31.175
Like, "I'll just be with anyone
who accepts me."

265
00:16:31.419 --> 00:16:34.375
"I wonder why
he didn't accept me."

266
00:16:34.681 --> 00:16:36.011
"Three scenes ago,"

267
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.722
"he was willing
to give up priesthood."

268
00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.545
"But now that I have his child,
he doesn't want to anymore."

269
00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:41.902
"What happened?"

270
00:16:42.372 --> 00:16:45.283
"I'll just go back
to the one who raped me then."

271
00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:49.306
In the end, she realized
she loved him apparently.

272
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:53.851
- In the first part, she constantly--
- A lot of things suddenly changed.

273
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.433
- She defended him.
Aren't women like that?

274
00:16:56.497 --> 00:17:01.947
- She kept on trying to understand him.
- It was justification.

275
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:09.854
But Victor convinced her to get out of it.

276
00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:12.778
I guess you have to also

277
00:17:12.954 --> 00:17:15.525
put yourselves
in the shoes of your characters

278
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.875
in terms of what they’ll decide
when confronted with this.

279
00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:24.703
If I were Sarah and I was free
from my husband,

280
00:17:24.803 --> 00:17:26.797
and Victor tells me that

281
00:17:26.998 --> 00:17:29.070
he'd continue with priesthood,

282
00:17:29.209 --> 00:17:33.177
I'd probably curse
the hell out of him

283
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:37.060
and leave this goddamn place!

284
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.438
- That's a good twist in a typical soap opera.
- But I'd probably feel like--

285
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.779
"What is with this situation?"

286
00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:47.275
"What is this? I sacrificed a lot
and almost died for you."

287
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.685
And then--
[inaudible]

288
00:17:53.044 --> 00:17:55.997
that was where I--

289
00:17:56.022 --> 00:17:57.054
I mean I could--

290
00:17:57.078 --> 00:18:01.805
I can still accept
the whole thing

291
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.192
because it’s in the sarsuwela mode.
And in the sarsuwela,

292
00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:08.124
we have Mauro as a
comic character.

293
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:09.419
You made him gay.

294
00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:14.956
Towards the end,
similar to musicals,

295
00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:18.414
it starts lightly with people
laughing and all

296
00:18:18.468 --> 00:18:21.281
until it reaches the end
with the killing scenes.

297
00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:24.252
If you notice,
most musicals are like that.

298
00:18:26.283 --> 00:18:28.703
Be it broadway or sarsuwela,

299
00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:34.105
it really needs to show
them falling and bleeding,

300
00:18:34.129 --> 00:18:38.451
their heart getting crushed,
and then something comes out.

301
00:18:38.514 --> 00:18:40.390
A phoenix rising from the ashes.

302
00:18:40.832 --> 00:18:45.732
The phoenix in this case
is the baby, the young boy.

303
00:18:50.405 --> 00:18:52.981
The problem is how
do we get there?

304
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.244
Because you started
with stock characters:

305
00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:05.253
a corrupt powerful politician
versus a newbie,

306
00:19:05.805 --> 00:19:13.792
a priest returning for vengeance.

307
00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:14.935
In the end,

308
00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:18.905
his objective changed
to getting the woman back.

309
00:19:20.405 --> 00:19:23.361
Since both are too strong,

310
00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:27.338
the only inevitable thing
that could happen

311
00:19:27.363 --> 00:19:33.210
is someone has to die
in order to get the woman.

312
00:19:33.257 --> 00:19:35.641
But you didn’t do that.

313
00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:40.559
You didn't kill anyone off,
not even the child.

314
00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:44.374
Sarah bled and all,
but the child clung for dear life.

315
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.881
Unlike in May's story where the baby
died instantly from just a push.

316
00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:52.808
- What a poor child, what a loose grip!

317
00:19:53.089 --> 00:19:56.178
If, because of that--

318
00:19:57.351 --> 00:20:02.428
I'm just describing what I think 
went on in your mind as an author

319
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:07.241
is you had to change it,
which made everything unconvincing.

320
00:20:07.436 --> 00:20:09.473
You end up unsure
why things happened.

321
00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:12.280
I think the problem's somewhere there.

322
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.767
You might have to
work your way back

323
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.652
to tweaking Jaime
and the other characters.

324
00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:26.088
- I just thought of this
as we're discussing...

325
00:20:30.365 --> 00:20:36.611
- Because of what happened,
Jaime’s character changed.

326
00:20:39.353 --> 00:20:44.010
- Removing the do-gooder part of Jaime,
- Which one?

327
00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:48.555
- His "turn around".
Removing that part,

328
00:20:49.595 --> 00:20:51.102
will it still be consistent?

329
00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.157
- But will Sarah
go back to him again?

330
00:20:54.813 --> 00:20:56.592
- Sarah would...

331
00:20:58.873 --> 00:21:00.525
- Women would refuse to go back.

332
00:21:00.572 --> 00:21:05.214
- Women’s rights groups
would tell her to leave.

333
00:21:05.457 --> 00:21:07.788
That’s the inevitable thing
that’ll happen,

334
00:21:07.815 --> 00:21:10.595
feminism aside.

335
00:21:12.463 --> 00:21:14.608
Right from the start,

336
00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:17.312
Sarah’s objective
 was to leave their marriage.

337
00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:21.670
Victor or no Victor.

338
00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:24.850
She just got braver
when Victor came.

339
00:21:25.346 --> 00:21:27.819
Suddenly, in the end,

340
00:21:28.794 --> 00:21:30.410
when she was free,

341
00:21:30.488 --> 00:21:32.258
she went back
to Jaime on her own.

342
00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:38.008
That's what made it iffy.

343
00:21:38.107 --> 00:21:40.490
Even if you change Jaime,

344
00:21:40.854 --> 00:21:43.482
you want to go to the ending

345
00:21:43.547 --> 00:21:46.849
that you saw in that town, right?

346
00:21:49.257 --> 00:21:52.027
The situation that you set up

347
00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:59.556
seems to be pointing
you to the inevitable end

348
00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:06.217
where either someone will die
to fix the whole dilemma

349
00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:09.859
or you need to tweak
the characters.

350
00:22:10.177 --> 00:22:13.910
There are a lot of possibilities
and alternatives.

351
00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:18.285
Jaime doesn't have to be
a corrupt politician.

352
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.373
His father may be the one.

353
00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.888
- But there's a stigma on Jaime.

354
00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:25.801
[inaudible]

355
00:22:25.849 --> 00:22:30.206
That’s the solution
I had for “Bayan Ko”.

356
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.918
The child was subservient,
but really didn't want to be.

357
00:22:36.014 --> 00:22:40.615
That gives him some
modicum of saving grace

358
00:22:40.657 --> 00:22:43.966
to fall in love with someone
from the other side.

359
00:22:44.705 --> 00:22:48.247
That will force him to get out.
Something like that.

360
00:22:49.222 --> 00:22:55.540
His marriage with Sarah
could've been arranged.

361
00:22:56.956 --> 00:22:58.958
You might have to tweak it.

362
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:02.870
I’m just giving you examples.
You don’t have to do that.

363
00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:10.307
All I'm saying is maybe
the fixing is not just at the last part

364
00:23:10.445 --> 00:23:12.975
for the ending
to be more convincing.

365
00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:17.797
Yes, maybe there’s a need
to revise things even from the start.

366
00:23:17.822 --> 00:23:19.313
Yeah, something like that.

367
00:23:20.414 --> 00:23:22.238
At the same time,
 you also want to show

368
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:29.042
how rotten the government 
and the church is.

369
00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:32.500
We don’t see it yet because all of them...

370
00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:40.837
They don’t seem to represent anything
that will really destroy the institutions.

371
00:23:41.213 --> 00:23:45.140
We don’t even know
who killed Victor’s father.

372
00:23:45.398 --> 00:23:47.441
- He had a promise
in the beginning with his dad.

373
00:23:47.486 --> 00:23:49.861
- I was thinking...
- "Noli Me Tangere" style.

374
00:23:49.893 --> 00:23:53.581
- Is Fr. Victor going for revenge,
just like the Crisostomo character?

375
00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:56.788
- But it turns out that was just part
of the background.

376
00:23:56.838 --> 00:24:02.102
- Which I thought was going to surface,
but instead the story focused on Sarah and Victor.

377
00:24:02.135 --> 00:24:03.494
That was where
his anger was coming from.

378
00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:07.501
- I think I was wrong
to take that part out

379
00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:10.200
because it was becoming too long.

380
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.531
- That's why...

381
00:24:12.894 --> 00:24:19.470
- There was one part I took out
because it reached about 110 pages.

382
00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:26.856
- It was about Jaime's father
who killed Victor's father.

383
00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:29.864
- Victor's father was locked
in the basement.

384
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.482
Yeah, but why did he kill him?

385
00:24:34.126 --> 00:24:35.191
Union leader?

386
00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:39.937
- He was the union leader
and already knew too much.

387
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:44.380
- And the most convenient way
to silence him is to just kill him.

388
00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:48.790
- Do you think
that will help your ending?

389
00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:52.173
- If not, he should probably
have some sort of sickness.

390
00:24:52.392 --> 00:24:55.314
- Unless, it helps move the plot

391
00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:59.143
and adds to the motivation
of the characters.

392
00:24:59.168 --> 00:25:01.727
- What I was thinking of, J-mee...

393
00:25:01.794 --> 00:25:05.109
Let's say it was Jaime’s father’s fault.

394
00:25:05.183 --> 00:25:08.774
- For Victor, one's sin
becomes the sin of the whole family.

395
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.061
- Very judgmental.
- Like a victim of circumstances.

396
00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:16.763
- There's an intermingling of accusations
that will lead to his revenge.

397
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.573
- It became a grudge.

398
00:25:20.053 --> 00:25:23.448
But he’s not taking revenge,
he just went back for Sarah?

399
00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:27.832
- He had an affair with Sarah.
Is that the revenge?

400
00:25:27.887 --> 00:25:29.807
- Did he even do anything?

401
00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:34.423
Actually, his "revenge" is to get Sarah.

402
00:25:34.626 --> 00:25:36.342
- Unless it was intentional.
- Victor knows she's really loved--

403
00:25:36.566 --> 00:25:38.353
- Ah, so it was intentional?
- He knows--

404
00:25:38.377 --> 00:25:41.976
Victor knows that Jaime
really loves Sarah.

405
00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:45.351
That's why he thought
of destroying their relationship.

406
00:25:46.167 --> 00:25:48.711
Actually, the issue
about the father disappeared,

407
00:25:48.772 --> 00:25:53.818
but in the beginning
you gave a hint

408
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:59.180
that Victor will discover the truth.

409
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.420
But that issue disappeared

410
00:26:02.496 --> 00:26:06.121
because all the attention went to Sarah

411
00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:10.224
which, I guess,
understandably, took much of the time

412
00:26:10.249 --> 00:26:12.185
because you really
had to set it all up.

413
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.327
That this whole thing
took four months.

414
00:26:18.721 --> 00:26:20.721
Maybe four months is too long.

415
00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.705
Pregnant women
 have bumps at four months.

416
00:26:25.427 --> 00:26:27.361
Won't Jaime wonder, "Dear,"

417
00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.783
"Why's your stomach
getting bigger?"

418
00:26:30.824 --> 00:26:36.029
There are too many over-the-top
scenes that are shocking.

419
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.443
Like, for example,

420
00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:43.764
in the beginning, Victor declares
he doesn't want to talk about the past

421
00:26:43.882 --> 00:26:45.089
in front of Jaime and Sarah.

422
00:26:45.114 --> 00:26:48.951
But when he sang,
he told them about everything.

423
00:26:48.998 --> 00:26:51.193
He ended up telling the story.

424
00:26:59.434 --> 00:27:03.445
There are dialogues
that are explanations

425
00:27:03.514 --> 00:27:06.450
which I think
would have been better as songs.

426
00:27:07.005 --> 00:27:08.789
Rather than saying,

427
00:27:08.903 --> 00:27:12.193
"When you left,
and so on and so forth."

428
00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:16.628
"I did this and that.
You don't know what happened to me."

429
00:27:16.849 --> 00:27:18.302
he should just sing it.

430
00:27:18.357 --> 00:27:21.019
There are scenes like those.

431
00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:23.348
- Yeah, the gossiping parts.

432
00:27:23.473 --> 00:27:27.332
Instead of gossiping,
they should just sing it.

433
00:27:30.364 --> 00:27:32.981
And then, okay,
I'll go through it one by one.

434
00:27:35.324 --> 00:27:39.366
I'm not so sure about this,
but Victor went to Manila

435
00:27:40.198 --> 00:27:43.340
with the hopes of making things
better for himself and Sarah

436
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:46.701
and that's when he heard
she got married?

437
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.773
Is that it?

438
00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:48.838
- Yeah.

439
00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:50.712
Why did Victor go to Manila?

440
00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:56.341
- He was studying philosophy,
not yet seminary.

441
00:27:56.373 --> 00:27:57.918
- He was a scholar.

442
00:27:57.958 --> 00:28:00.596
- He didn’t go there for his duties.

443
00:28:00.622 --> 00:28:01.778
Okay.

444
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.761
When he found out that Sarah got married...

445
00:28:03.971 --> 00:28:07.261
- The parish priest who adopted him

446
00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:12.980
convinced him 
not to go back to San Nicolas.

447
00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:16.724
He urged Victor
to become a priest instead.

448
00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:20.516
Even if he didn’t want to,
the priest convinced him still.

449
00:28:21.676 --> 00:28:24.527
So he agreed when he learned
Sarah got married?

450
00:28:24.832 --> 00:28:27.311
- Yeah, because he learned
they got married.

451
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.301
Isn’t it too late for him
to become a priest?

452
00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:35.671
How long were they married?

453
00:28:36.573 --> 00:28:38.359
How long were they married?

454
00:28:38.792 --> 00:28:40.515
- Does it take 10 years to become a priest?
- Around 10 years.

455
00:28:40.547 --> 00:28:44.143
- They’re married for 10 years?
- Yes, they've been married for 10 years.

456
00:28:44.168 --> 00:28:47.794
- And they still don't have a child?
See, Jaime's really infertile.

457
00:28:48.278 --> 00:28:50.331
- So he rapes her still.

458
00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:58.298
The scene we just read,
I find it redundant.

459
00:28:59.006 --> 00:29:03.615
Even before the monsignor
found them having sex,

460
00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:06.979
Victor already voiced out
that he didn’t want to be a priest.

461
00:29:07.118 --> 00:29:09.308
So what's this scene for?

462
00:29:09.522 --> 00:29:11.828
If he didn’t want
to become a priest anymore,

463
00:29:12.304 --> 00:29:15.811
the next scene I would expect
is Victor packing up his things.

464
00:29:18.027 --> 00:29:21.948
I mean what do you need to show,
he's just saying...

465
00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:27.044
The monsignor just keeps
 telling him she’s married.

466
00:29:27.069 --> 00:29:29.279
For him to stop everything.

467
00:29:31.162 --> 00:29:33.315
- That's where I got--
- In the scene where they got caught?

468
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.370
That part.

469
00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.770
Afterwards,
Victor was very defiant.

470
00:29:38.061 --> 00:29:42.880
"No, I won't leave Sarah.
I've made my choice."

471
00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:45.228
"I'll leave priesthood behind."

472
00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:47.731
Of course, the monsignor
is shocked to hear this.

473
00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.755
Then after that,

474
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:52.846
the scene ended just like that,
with Sarah leaving

475
00:29:53.214 --> 00:29:55.964
and Victor determined

476
00:29:56.614 --> 00:29:59.964
to get out of priesthood
for Sarah.

477
00:30:01.588 --> 00:30:03.962
But after that Victor goes,

478
00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:06.703
"Go ahead Father, scold me. Swear at me."

479
00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:09.428
It's like, wait a minute.

480
00:30:09.653 --> 00:30:12.968
The monsignor was probably thinking,
"I thought you were already leaving?"

481
00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:20.248
I’m confused because the issue
keeps on repeating

482
00:30:20.273 --> 00:30:23.185
instead of moving forward.

483
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:25.482
- It could be...

484
00:30:26.121 --> 00:30:32.317
- Could this scene and the scene
where they get caught happen simultaneously?

485
00:30:33.007 --> 00:30:36.056
That's a possibility.
You could connect it there.

486
00:30:37.263 --> 00:30:38.385
Could be.

487
00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:40.746
But you should remove the

488
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.652
"When I was young..." and so on part.

489
00:30:44.731 --> 00:30:47.832
Go directly to your moth metaphor,

490
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.668
like whatever you're going to do

491
00:30:51.688 --> 00:30:54.731
will burn you in the end.
Something like that.

492
00:30:55.764 --> 00:31:02.020
Although I really want you
to look for another metaphor,

493
00:31:02.052 --> 00:31:03.686
- because that one's already--
- A cliche.

494
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:09.676
It's Teodora Alonzo's metaphor.

495
00:31:12.673 --> 00:31:16.204
It's from Jose Rizal's time.

496
00:31:18.096 --> 00:31:19.546
And then one more thing,

497
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:22.048
the villagers' song number

498
00:31:22.431 --> 00:31:27.263
where Sarah gets dragged away

499
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.433
and suddenly there’s
an intermission number

500
00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:35.005
where the villagers go,
"Have you heard?" and so on.

501
00:31:35.281 --> 00:31:41.420
Finally, when the song ended,
you still continued with that scene.

502
00:31:43.005 --> 00:31:48.053
- I used it as a device
so there'll be time for set change.

503
00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:52.586
It doesn't need to be changed.
Just remove everything.

504
00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:55.899
You could remove
that whole part

505
00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:02.446
because it lessens
the momentum.

506
00:32:03.117 --> 00:32:05.156
Skip to the part
where they're caught...

507
00:32:05.211 --> 00:32:08.977
They were caught.
Then Jaime got ahold of Sarah,

508
00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:13.290
He already had her,
but suddenly the people appear,

509
00:32:13.352 --> 00:32:16.735
and so many rumors have spread.

510
00:32:16.797 --> 00:32:20.336
Then you cut back
to Jaime still holding her.

511
00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:23.024
Just remove it
and go forward.

512
00:32:26.293 --> 00:32:31.129
If you want it to be short,
maybe with Mauro or whoever,

513
00:32:31.226 --> 00:32:34.609
one blackout is enough.

514
00:32:34.696 --> 00:32:36.260
How about you?

515
00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:38.007
Ellen.

516
00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:42.015
- For me, it just seems like...

517
00:32:42.084 --> 00:32:45.893
- I think the two characters,
although this happens in real life,

518
00:32:45.925 --> 00:32:49.735
seemed inconsistent.

519
00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:52.609
- Like the priest, who was taking up something else,

520
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:55.437
but when told to become a priest, he agrees.

521
00:32:55.476 --> 00:32:57.953
- Then he came back
and learned Sarah was raped

522
00:32:57.986 --> 00:33:01.930
- so he decided to leave priesthood for her,
but in the end, he gave her up.

523
00:33:02.027 --> 00:33:03.886
- Doesn't it seem so...

524
00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:07.210
- What’s the growth in his character?

525
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.405
- He's always been inconsistent
with what he really wants.

526
00:33:11.659 --> 00:33:13.292
- It’s the same for the woman.

527
00:33:13.338 --> 00:33:16.441
- She really loved this guy,
but then she got raped.

528
00:33:16.475 --> 00:33:20.332
- She couldn't tell anyone,
and so she agreed to get married.

529
00:33:21.325 --> 00:33:23.755
- But she still liked Victor.

530
00:33:23.807 --> 00:33:25.965
- And in the end,
she came back to Jaime.

531
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.427
- Their resolve
always seems to waver.

532
00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:31.996
- So I don't know about their growth as characters.

533
00:33:32.137 --> 00:33:35.678
- Or did they just accept the traps?
That's the ending?

534
00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:38.435
- But you started the play

535
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:44.294
with the impression
that it’d be a rebellious play.

536
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:49.034
- That it would turn the tables

537
00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:52.681
turn the tables on the church,
on politics, and on love.

538
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:54.571
- Because I remember
when you were talking about this

539
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.330
at its early stages that it was okay
to love more than one person.

540
00:33:58.355 --> 00:34:03.894
- That you’re going to turn around
the concepts of love, politics, church.

541
00:34:03.971 --> 00:34:05.635
- And yet the ending,

542
00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:12.095
it went back
to the sanctity of marriage,

543
00:34:12.164 --> 00:34:15.697
the oath of priesthood,

544
00:34:15.758 --> 00:34:20.111
even if he never really chose
that as a vocation.

545
00:34:20.523 --> 00:34:23.304
- That's what confuses me.

546
00:34:23.442 --> 00:34:29.388
- I was set up to believe
that you’d turn the tables on institutions

547
00:34:30.592 --> 00:34:32.285
but in the end...

548
00:34:35.637 --> 00:34:39.231
- Based on Mauro's
criticism and comments,

549
00:34:40.395 --> 00:34:44.981
it's a very pretentious society,
full of hypocrisies.

550
00:34:45.112 --> 00:34:46.382
- Yet in the end,

551
00:34:46.702 --> 00:34:53.852
they stick to all the trappings
of the church, of marriage.

552
00:34:54.085 --> 00:34:55.749
- That's where I'm confused.

553
00:34:56.674 --> 00:34:59.853
- I thought

554
00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:04.103
of all those trappings

555
00:35:04.197 --> 00:35:06.058
as the hypocrisies themselves.

556
00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:14.034
- You know it’s wrong,
but we still tolerate it.

557
00:35:14.334 --> 00:35:18.040
- "I'll just live with it" kind of thinking.

558
00:35:18.395 --> 00:35:20.899
- So the ending is actually sad

559
00:35:20.962 --> 00:35:24.243
because they all chose
to remain in their traps.

560
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:27.715
- It’s supposed to be a sad ending.

561
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.990
- The child grew up properly,

562
00:35:33.045 --> 00:35:38.059
but everyone is trapped
in their own miseries.

563
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.643
- Well that happens.

564
00:35:42.742 --> 00:35:46.403
If that’s what you’re going to do,

565
00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:50.122
then you have to be clear about it.

566
00:35:50.621 --> 00:35:57.450
It will therefore be in the framing
of the characters themselves.

567
00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.544
How you define them.

568
00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:03.278
Because right now, everything feels so sudden.

569
00:36:03.342 --> 00:36:07.792
Why's the mayor suddenly good?
Why'd this suddenly happen?

570
00:36:07.863 --> 00:36:09.280
Those kinds of things.

571
00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:14.754
The objective
 needs to be singular.

572
00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:16.809
It’s either the character
gets it or not.

573
00:36:16.857 --> 00:36:21.141
The characters can't suddenly
just change decisions.

574
00:36:26.088 --> 00:36:28.133
80% of the play

575
00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:33.365
they seem to be very determined
to do everything they promised to do.

576
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.643
Remember our lesson on speech acts?

577
00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.493
When Victor declared,

578
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.242
"I can and I will renounce
priesthood for Sarah."

579
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.548
And then in one swift scene,

580
00:36:47.876 --> 00:36:49.953
"I'll just go back to priesthood"

581
00:36:50.015 --> 00:36:52.527
"because my child lived."

582
00:36:53.035 --> 00:36:54.720
It's a bit...

583
00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:56.488
There's an imbalance, right?

584
00:36:56.693 --> 00:37:03.076
That’s the kind of thing
that’s done just to align with the ending.

585
00:37:03.818 --> 00:37:05.825
- Actually, the statement is good

586
00:37:05.872 --> 00:37:11.063
because in truth, a lot of people
continue even within their traps.

587
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:16.537
- Since that’s your ending,
I think the needed setup is,

588
00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:20.974
- the next stage is the power
of the institutions.

589
00:37:22.469 --> 00:37:24.328
- The power of the church,

590
00:37:24.414 --> 00:37:30.881
- the communal beliefs that trap
 individuals in situations they don’t want.

591
00:37:30.986 --> 00:37:32.838
- How do you set up that power?

592
00:37:32.892 --> 00:37:37.068
- That even Victor,

593
00:37:37.178 --> 00:37:41.249
who sings about not giving up
even when getting burnt,

594
00:37:41.379 --> 00:37:43.860
and yet gives up...

595
00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:46.453
- What are those traps?

596
00:37:47.594 --> 00:37:52.354
- I don't know the play's scope,
but if that's the message

597
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.116
- Then you’re talking
about powerful institutions

598
00:37:56.165 --> 00:38:02.208
that individuals can’t seem to get away from.

599
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:08.744
- It’s a different kind of melodrama,
it's no longer drama.

600
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.435
- We're pushing
the limits of the genre.

601
00:38:10.577 --> 00:38:13.635
- 'Cause it's usually very liberating.

602
00:38:14.034 --> 00:38:17.445
It works for a sarsuwela.

603
00:38:23.822 --> 00:38:26.288
The definition of the characters

604
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.363
are falling apart,

605
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:29.902
are unstable.

606
00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:33.204
- It changed in the middle somewhere.

607
00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:36.580
- In sarsuwelas,
they can pursue that...

608
00:38:37.673 --> 00:38:45.462
Even I can’t see the promise
that Ellen (offscreen) is looking for.

609
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.735
Because in the end,
Mauro disappeared.

610
00:38:50.781 --> 00:38:54.375
And he’s the only one
who sees everything in that light.

611
00:38:54.524 --> 00:38:56.166
And he’s not a revolutionary.

612
00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:58.546
He’s also an outcast
in a sense

613
00:38:58.948 --> 00:39:02.165
because he’s gay, right?

614
00:39:02.947 --> 00:39:07.556
So he’s not taken seriously,
which is a nice touch.

615
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.242
He’s like Cassandra
who’s telling the truth,

616
00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:15.625
but nobody takes him seriously
just because he’s gay.

617
00:39:16.885 --> 00:39:19.355
Maybe he should have a song on that.
