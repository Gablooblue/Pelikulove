00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:18.338
When I chose Diana Ross,

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.634
somehow this line
suddenly came to mind,

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:22.248
“Do you know
where you’re going to?”

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.529
And immediately,
I thought of the line

00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:30.439
having meaning to a character

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.450
 who was lost in life

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:36.738
Somehow, that’s the first song
that came into place

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.566
which is why I wanted Diana Ross.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:41.443
During the rehearsals,

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:45.518
Soxie, the director,

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.363
helped to complete the play.

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:52.071
I only knew “I’m Coming Out”
should be there.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.558
But for example, songs like
“Heart, Don’t Change My Mind,”

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.004
but Soxie was going for “Muscles”

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:02.819
because he knew
Diana Ross’s songs better.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.959
And from there, the scenes

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:09.038
somehow started falling into places.

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:12.945
which I intended
to be the foundation,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.824
and what would thread
the storytelling,

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:19.765
So the structure was partly

00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:24.167
defined by the songs of Diana Ross.

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.377
In a way, those became
the scene titles,

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.690
something like that.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.641
- Did you intend
to write it at full-length?

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:35.873
Yes, I wrote it at full-length.

00:01:38.818 --> 00:01:41.665
Well, it was a twin bill.

00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:44.587
“Damas de Noche”,
if I’m not mistaken, was a one act play.

00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:47.187
This one,

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:49.510
 I guess, I just couldn’t stop writing

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.327
that’s why it developed so much.

00:01:51.352 --> 00:01:55.718
It was rich with experiences.

00:01:56.334 --> 00:02:01.164
From the seminarists
to the corporate world

00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:03.613
in the last part, right?

00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:08.435
Since we have friends from the bank,

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.275
they tell us how it should be.

00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:13.066
At that time,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.196
 coming out could affect

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.942
your career ladder,

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:25.362
So, that’s what I got
from synthesizing

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.201
the experiences from that conclave.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.763
The flow of the story

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:35.816
are like snapshots

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:38.048
of the different phases in his life

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.014
but somehow,
it was all about

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.553
talking about

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:47.506
either accepting
or rejecting one's self.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:51.741
So you’ll notice
that it differs each phase.

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:52.921
At first,

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.784
he was defended.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.349
Second, he rejected it.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.119
Third,

00:03:02.013 --> 00:03:04.832
he failed rejecting it.

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:06.768
So he needed the–

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.948
probably because of the alcohol.

00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:13.366
He gave in.

00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:16.659
Fourth,

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.530
at the cusp of the marriage,

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:23.372
he was caught as consequence

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:27.010
to giving in to the desire.

00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:29.072
The fifth

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:30.574
 is acceptance,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.733
finally.

00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:35.254
There was that aspect
if you noticed it.

00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:39.757
Of course, it wasn’t that clear yet
when I was writing it.

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:44.755
So, I had a lot of luck

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:48.379
at that time.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.526
But it was also intuitive,
in deciding what happened

00:03:51.573 --> 00:03:55.297
at which part of the character’s life.

00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:57.344
In the course of that also,

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:00.865
while writing,
I had to do it chronologically

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.580
because I didn’t know how to do
one scene ahead of the last.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:08.437
I had to do it chonologically
so I could only follow

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:11.948
his life as I created it.

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:15.175
- Why did you think of using
pictures as transitions?

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:18.405
Yes, my inspiration
came from photographs.

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:21.977
But when it was produced,
Soxie did it differently.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.104
He dramatized it.

00:04:24.457 --> 00:04:27.280
They’d enter and exit with costumes.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.857
And afterwards, they'd do
a quick costume change

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.694
and when they come back,
it’s a different one.

00:04:32.558 --> 00:04:34.267
They improvised.

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:37.692
So they had to do it all

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:39.862
while singing

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:42.309
and the rest would usher in.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.510
So that on the latter part
of “I’m Coming Out”,

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.474
they’re dancing already.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.888
That was their curtain call.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:53.299
- Did you include

00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.723
the director’s approach
in your script?

00:04:57.078 --> 00:05:01.371
No, I didn’t include it.

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:02.572
- So, you disagree with it?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.222
No, it’s not that I disagree.

00:05:04.247 --> 00:05:07.792
It’s just that,
I wasn’t able to record–

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:12.447
to document those scenes.

00:05:12.754 --> 00:05:14.167
Something like that.

00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:19.723
The slides weren’t improvised

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.508
to the letter, either.

00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:27.787
So when I signed this up
for Palanca, I told myself,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.054
My god! Instead of going through
it again, I thought this would do.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:34.256
It’s just transitions anyway.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.304
The main point was to make Diana
look like she’s having a concert.

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:42.433
Somehow, lip-syncing

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.985
to the gestures is very gay

00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:47.903
because Diana was a gay icon.

00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:52.194
Plus, the actual act
of impersonation

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:57.599
is a fabulously gay

00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:58.730
event.

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:00.132
Something like that.

00:06:00.178 --> 00:06:04.575
- Is this what started
the gay plays of 1991?

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.331
No, this wasn’t the start.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:10.318
The first was Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero.

00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:15.276
I guess, one of the first gay plays ever

00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:19.334
written was
Wilfrido Ma.Guerrero’s

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:20.892
“The Clash of Cymbals”.

00:06:21.324 --> 00:06:27.173
It’s also about
the difficulty of coming out.

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.516
The next one’s Orlando Nadres.

00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:35.241
- “Hanggang Dito…”

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.861
His “Hanggang Dito na Lamang...”

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.249
This one’s more celebratory
because he was accepted.

00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:46.814
Orlando’s “Hanggang Dito…”
was unlike any other.

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:51.680
He fell in love with a straight guy
and it became something.

00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:57.603
It showed that it’s okay
to have a gay relationship.

00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.153
The evolution is quite slow.

00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:01.476
-Yes!

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:04.312
The consciousness but…

00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:06.289
- It's not the same today?

00:07:06.314 --> 00:07:07.326
What do you mean?

00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:08.468
- There are a lot of plays like it.

00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:10.496
There are a lot.
I came–after this,

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.926
my next play
was “Ralph and Claudia”

00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:15.272
which is about a transgender.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:19.865
However, it wasn’t well-accepted

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.690
even by the gay community.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.480
In fact,

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.776
feminists understood it more.

00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:29.801
Well, that’s another story,
but anyway this was my process.

00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:34.954
- Is there any other way
you would restructure this?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.346
If it was me?

00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.492
- If given the chance.

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:47.039
If it was me, I wouldn’t know

00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:51.856
because it was meant
for Diana Ross’ songs.

00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:57.062
It’s either you change the songs
to fix them the way you want

00:07:57.095 --> 00:08:00.187
or you could create
different scenes

00:08:00.226 --> 00:08:01.751
if you want to update it.

00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:03.807
- Like use Beyonce’s songs.

00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:08.265
- Did anyone respond to the play?

00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:09.535
What?

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.838
- Any responses to it?

00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:11.885
To this?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.672
There were none.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.132
There weren't any.

00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:21.941
At the same time,
the sensibilities are different nowadays.

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:25.120
The difficulties
in coming out have changed.

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.014
I’m sure that some people still struggle,

00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:32.414
but not to the tune of Diana Ross.

00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:35.040
But at the same time–

00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:38.312
- Ariana Grande.

00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:40.971
What else?
May?

00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:45.271
- Which was formed first?
The songs or the scenes?

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:46.788
The scenes.

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:50.660
One inspiration was Diana Ross,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.065
that’s why the title came first in a way,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.572
although it was incomplete.

00:08:56.597 --> 00:08:58.740
One song was “Do You Know”.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.188
I knew I wanted to use it

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.589
as inspiration for a scene.

00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:05.024
Something like that.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:08.184
So, the scene was formed.

00:09:08.223 --> 00:09:10.701
and the second scene was perfect.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:14.468
After that, I put
“Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”.

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:18.296
Those were the early days of Diana Ross.
They were still the Supremes.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.734
In the eyes of young Andy,
early Diana Ross was just right.

00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:26.367
That’s the next thing
that came along.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.054
I don’t know much
about “Muscles”.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.373
Soxie was the one
who introduced it

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:36.159
and “Heart, Don’t Change My Mind”.

00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:39.997
I was actually thinking
about Billie Holiday at that time

00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:42.253
because she did
“Lady Sings the Blues”.

00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:45.171
Soxie wasn’t up for it
and thought we should use

00:09:46.516 --> 00:09:50.527
“Good Morning Heartache”
for the gunshot scene.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.296
That's when she sang
Billie Holiday.

00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:55.083
“I’m Coming Out” came after.

00:09:55.953 --> 00:10:01.266
So I think there were two songs
where I didn’t know what to put.

00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:03.348
- Diana Ross
didn't know, either?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.286
No.

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.820
- Was she a gay icon here?

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.378
Yes, oh my god!

00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.084
-'Til now?

00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:13.121
People don't know her anymore?

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:15.072
- But RuPaul, right?

00:10:15.097 --> 00:10:17.474
RuPaul re-introduced her.

00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:22.482
-Yes, he re-introduced it
to the new generation.

00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:27.617
Diana and Barang
were the gay icons.

00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.470
Barbara Streisand.

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:35.637
Every gay person
 was dying to impersonate her.

00:10:35.692 --> 00:10:38.202
- Didn't the first drag queens
have that Diana Ross look?

00:10:38.249 --> 00:10:40.389
Yeah, that look.

00:10:41.047 --> 00:10:43.350
-So, it was okay?
I mean, when he used it?

00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:46.876
I’m not so sure
if we remake it,

00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:48.566
especially today.

00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:51.576
At that time,
you could get away with it.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.889
It wasn’t an issue
because it was lip-synced.

00:10:57.686 --> 00:11:02.606
It was a gay bar fare.

00:11:02.637 --> 00:11:05.199
It was one of the most commonly used…

00:11:05.254 --> 00:11:07.004
- In terms of writing,

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:09.811
when interviewing about
the politics of gays,

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.123
was it a conscious thing…?

00:11:12.162 --> 00:11:17.679
Because Orlando’s character
was falling in love with a straight guy.

00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:23.114
The gay character here seems to have
more consciousness about other gays.

00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:28.375
Was there a conscious effort
to create this kind of character?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.076
Yes, in the sense that

00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:32.646
it was also one
of the issues that came out

00:11:32.717 --> 00:11:35.075
during the conclave discussions.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:39.435
That it doesn’t have to be…

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.993
because in most sob stories

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:47.742
you fall in love with a person

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:50.585
who doesn’t share
the same gender preference.

00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:53.554
You end up having to

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:58.664
provide for that person

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:02.200
just to complete the relationship.

00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:06.388
But actually, there’s that option

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:13.816
to be in a relationship
with fellow gays

00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:16.911
Or those who share
the same preference,

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.595
so it’s mutual in a way.

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:27.067
But, it’s still a coming out play

00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:29.567
so it’s not so different from…

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:33.777
But that’s the thing,
if you count the years

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.220
it seemed like forever
before plays like this

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:40.451
and this is how it’s advanced
in terms of output

00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:43.184
of the story.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:49.250
- It’s like a snapshot of how it was
back in the early 90s.

00:12:49.313 --> 00:12:51.517
Kind of, yes.

00:12:51.548 --> 00:12:56.944
Or I think, it was more of a synthesis
of what we have discussed

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:58.747
together.

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:01.338
I guess a lot of the people

00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:03.205
who watched the show

00:13:03.697 --> 00:13:07.108
were affected.

00:13:07.135 --> 00:13:09.015
In fact, there was a full spread

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:16.334
on a writer who came out
using his piece

00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:18.655
because of the play.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.335
So I said, okay, go!

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:23.900
Something like that.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.205
So, that’s how I wrote the play.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.706
Did I make a scenario?

00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:28.978
I did.

00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:32.147
I remember having done a scenario

00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:38.056
just to find out
what each scene contained.

00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:41.494
It wasn’t a very detailed scenario.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.370
Primarily because I was partly drawing

00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:47.931
from my personal experience.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.696
So more or less,
the scene was clear to me.

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:54.346
How the mommy and the daddy
would go about the scene.

00:13:57.156 --> 00:13:58.992
What they'd say–

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.940
The scenes from seminary
were largely from research.

00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:09.709
Then I imagined
what would happen to...

00:14:09.776 --> 00:14:11.954
The repartee, for example.

00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:18.734
Some of them came from me,

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:22.500
like the exorcism part.

00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:26.456
Plus, I can clearly remember

00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:28.668
in my program notes

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.197
it was my coming out.

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:34.673
I went and declared
that this was mine

00:14:35.469 --> 00:14:38.407
because I wasn’t fully “out” at that time.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.555
When we held the preview,
I realized I had to tweak some parts.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:47.163
There was a part where Susan said,

00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:49.511
 “I’m giving this back to you
since it’s a factory defect.”

00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:50.414
Is it still there?

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:51.766
- Not anymore.

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:55.967
We removed it because of the reaction
of the first preview audience.

00:14:57.469 --> 00:14:59.777
Is she seriously
going to say “factory defect”?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.773
The impact was huge.

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:07.787
Apparently, the remark
had such a huge effect,

00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:12.516
that the impact might backfire

00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:15.818
instead of portraying it
as something indecent.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:20.291
It might reinforce
that kind of thinking

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.260
and be used
as an insult to children.

00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:26.113
So we removed it.

00:15:26.144 --> 00:15:29.115
- So you can’t say that it was just part
of Susan’s character in defense?

00:15:29.154 --> 00:15:30.735
The thing is,

00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:37.018
these terms could be taken out
of context outside the theater.

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:41.942
- Was there a time when you
came across a book or a script

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:44.628
that inspired you to use in this script?

00:15:44.658 --> 00:15:47.752
- Like say, in projecting lines,
dialogue, or something.

00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:48.611
For this play?

00:15:48.637 --> 00:15:49.846
- Yeah.

00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:56.062
- Or based on what you read before.
Was there a conscious…?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:03.251
For this play,
I think there was none.

00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:06.628
- But, what triggered this is the…

00:16:06.938 --> 00:16:08.492
The discussion.

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:12.340
That’s where I got
all the experiences.

00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:17.443
- So it was with the intention
of creating a play from experiences.

00:16:17.506 --> 00:16:22.046
There were a lot of discussions.

00:16:22.113 --> 00:16:25.671
We even went for a retreat,
an overnight thing,

00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:27.436
sometimes, swimming.

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:31.874
After we had that,
some people started crying

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:34.390
and telling their stories.

00:16:34.444 --> 00:16:37.276
Then we had drinks,
then a party later on.

00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:39.739
But during those discussions,

00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:42.449
I wasn’t thinking
about the play yet.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:47.531
After that, since most of us
were from PETA,

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:49.672
we decided to create a play.

00:16:49.727 --> 00:16:52.862
It fell into my lap then,
I started getting stories.

00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:56.066
Even the...

00:16:56.117 --> 00:16:58.989
Specifically, for this scene we read

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.414
about the life in the seminary.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.989
The old seminarians shared
quite a lot of stories,

00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:09.952
even quoting Virgil.

00:17:10.987 --> 00:17:12.476
"The Aeneid".

00:17:12.757 --> 00:17:17.396
Those were the first lines:
<i>“Arma virumque cano”</i>

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.559
which means
“I sing of arms and men”.

00:17:19.598 --> 00:17:20.660
Something like that.

00:17:21.754 --> 00:17:25.154
He told us that they
were studying that in Latin.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.019
Since the translation
was “I sing of arms and men”,

00:17:29.128 --> 00:17:33.613
I thought that it was perfect
to make a new definition,

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.282
So that's what I did.

00:17:36.704 --> 00:17:41.228
Even the <i>manuallia</i>
where they have to do manual labor.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.649
They had to clean the bathroom,
scrub the floor.

00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:46.892
Those were part of the interviews.

00:17:47.787 --> 00:17:51.075
It was an attempt
to somehow synthesize

00:17:51.123 --> 00:17:53.712
what happened
during the discussions.

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:56.448
- Aside from the pictures,

00:17:56.535 --> 00:18:02.178
was the rest of it
 untouched by Direk Soxie?

00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:05.785
Yes, that was it.

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:08.868
I guess in sharing that,

00:18:08.923 --> 00:18:13.105
plays go through
different journeys.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.996
It doesn’t have to go
through this journey.

00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:20.587
But, this journey came
from personal and other experiences.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.585
But still, the craft would come in

00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:29.899
because it would demand

00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:34.207
how you’d elevate it

00:18:34.263 --> 00:18:38.965
to the level of theatricality.

00:18:39.234 --> 00:18:42.534
And with theatricality
comes the fictionalizing.

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:47.235
Focusing on what you
really want to show and so on.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.963
And not just replicating

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:52.365
what happened in reality

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.813
because it doesn’t mean anything

00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:59.662
in making and writing
for theatre or even for film.

00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:04.549
Beginning writers would always say,

00:19:04.574 --> 00:19:06.079
“Because it happened.”

00:19:06.118 --> 00:19:07.491
So what?

00:19:10.344 --> 00:19:14.183
If it won’t help you

00:19:14.238 --> 00:19:17.280
to become more effective
in showing what you really want to say,

00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:22.732
about this particular story
or inside this particular story,

00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:25.576
then you can tweak it.

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:28.943
That’s where you play “God”,

00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:31.951
in that sense.

00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:35.698
Like I said before,
even biographies

00:19:35.747 --> 00:19:40.873
like the life of Winston Churchill
and Emilio Aguinaldo.

00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:45.101
To the certain extent,

00:19:45.126 --> 00:19:48.824
the mere fact that you’re editing those,

00:19:48.864 --> 00:19:52.573
you’re cutting unnecessary
and inappropriate things.

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:55.700
You’re creating a new image
for Emilio Aguinaldo.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.690
That’s why El Presidente’s
Emilio Aguinaldo

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:01.981
is different from Heneral Luna’s.

00:20:04.097 --> 00:20:11.143
But both will claim
that they came from historical sources.

00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:14.653
See? You can demonize him

00:20:16.387 --> 00:20:19.641
and make him an angel.

00:20:24.128 --> 00:20:26.725
Both are not Emilio Aguinaldo.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.211
They are characters.

00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:32.340
Even Tony Kushner’s
Abraham Lincoln.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.647
That’s why a historian
will always get aggravated

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:43.087
and tell you
those aren't accurate.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.098
A film or a play
is not really after accuracy <i>per se</i>,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.544
as long as you
don’t distort the basic facts.

00:20:53.857 --> 00:20:58.053
- In terms of Diana’s character,

00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:02.974
- Did you create rules
on what she knows here–

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:04.137
On what she...?

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.751
- She knows
or doesn’t know?

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:12.235
- Because it’s like
she’s Andy’s consciousness.

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:18.427
- Her gay consciousness.
But in this scene,

00:21:18.452 --> 00:21:23.756
Andy knows things
that Diana doesn’t.

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:28.256
Andy knows things
that Diana doesn’t?

00:21:28.281 --> 00:21:32.829
-Yes, like when they
were talking about what happened.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.307
- About why Father Bobby got mad.

00:21:37.437 --> 00:21:43.289
- Diana knows nothing
about what Andy knows.

00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:45.070
No, she knows.
She was there.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:47.989
- It’s like she was saying
that it wasn’t right.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.092
- It was more her reaction
rather than I don’t know that.

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:54.287
- She's doing more of a reaction.

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:59.725
There was never a scene

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.871
where Diana seemed ignorant
about things that happened.

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:14.712
Although she mentioned
“I was suspended”.

00:22:14.728 --> 00:22:16.451
It was just her way
of saying things,

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:21.042
it's not really because
she doesn’t know,

00:22:21.659 --> 00:22:23.064
or she's not around.

00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:25.883
- It’s like she’s already processing…

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.879
Because she’s already nervous
even before she's told.

00:22:28.997 --> 00:22:33.838
- I was just thinking that we have
imaginary characters

00:22:35.703 --> 00:22:38.040
if we follow rules.

00:22:39.809 --> 00:22:44.726
Well, you’ll dictate
the rules you’ll follow

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:53.636
As long as you
don't break it yourself

00:22:53.687 --> 00:22:55.427
then it's fine.

00:22:55.866 --> 00:23:01.805
She’s like Andy’s consciousness,

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:05.958
when he’s more or less
excited or stressed,

00:23:05.983 --> 00:23:07.921
that’s where it comes out.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.611
“I thought you were calling me.”
“I didn’t call you.”

00:23:11.636 --> 00:23:19.564
But actually, a certain desire
or a certain context triggers that.

00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:21.260
- I was thinking,
like for example…

00:23:21.308 --> 00:23:23.290
- I’m conjuring a ghost

00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:27.758
or a dead person to
talk to the character.

00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:31.695
- If it’s an imagined being,

00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:39.280
- I’m thinking about
what the being should know

00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:43.198
about the character,
about the person.

00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:48.624
Usually, if it’s an imagined being,
the character itself imagined it.

00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:51.129
- Like when Agapito Flores appears

00:23:52.536 --> 00:23:54.644
but it turns out it's not
actually Agapito Flores.

00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:59.246
- How the character
sees Agapito Flores.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.800
- A projection.

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:05.163
- So would Agapito Flores
know my life?

00:24:05.437 --> 00:24:06.440
- It's your choice.

00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:10.947
- I mean with the way
I'd converse with that being.

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:12.431
Possibly, yes.

00:24:12.814 --> 00:24:18.662
But that concern
could actually be irrelevant,

00:24:18.718 --> 00:24:22.054
because what you’re really doing,

00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:23.833
especially if he’s imagined,

00:24:25.285 --> 00:24:27.261
is talking to yourself.

00:24:27.294 --> 00:24:28.176
Right?

00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:34.165
So, I guess the “self”
is aware of what’s happening.

00:24:34.745 --> 00:24:38.096
But for you to be able to put it
in a dramatic situation,

00:24:38.274 --> 00:24:42.122
You’re creating another
persona of Agapito Flores.

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:44.114
to have a conversation

00:24:44.141 --> 00:24:47.347
and it’s also your way
of telling the audience

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.967
what’s happening
or what they need to know.

00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:53.596
Because if they
both know about everything,

00:24:53.621 --> 00:24:55.278
why would they talk about it?

00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:59.308
- Agapito could know about
the facts about that character,

00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:02.856
but not what
that character feels right now.

00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:04.174
Could be.

00:25:06.187 --> 00:25:09.387
Or why am I conjured now?

00:25:09.987 --> 00:25:11.130
Or what do you need?

00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:12.588
It could be like that.

00:25:14.282 --> 00:25:15.798
So we’d be able to say,

00:25:15.823 --> 00:25:20.320
Or it could also be
the same with Charles Dickens.

00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:21.836
It suddenly appeared.

00:25:21.894 --> 00:25:25.407
Because you need
to be given a lesson.

00:25:25.664 --> 00:25:26.917
"A Christmas Carol", remember?

00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:28.960
That’s why Marley’s ghost came.

00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:32.628
At that point, the ghost
knew more than him.

00:25:32.683 --> 00:25:34.475
“I came here to warn you.”

00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:36.237
Something like that.

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:42.113
It could be either way,
any way you want.

00:25:42.772 --> 00:25:47.718
Well, it usually only happens
to emphasize the struggle.

00:25:47.758 --> 00:25:49.489
For example, here,

00:25:49.543 --> 00:25:54.454
I created Diana Ross
to clear her struggle

00:25:54.479 --> 00:26:00.331
because firstly it would be corny
to see her talking to herself.

00:26:00.807 --> 00:26:04.915
He’s gay, but singing
without a song, that’s weird.

00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:09.809
Something like that
It’s not fab.

00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:13.121
At least, this one
gives robotic vibes.

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:15.084
with extravagant hair.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.873
Every time he enters the frame,

00:26:17.904 --> 00:26:19.458
Melvin Lee wears a different costume.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.711
And on “Muscles”,
he's wearing a tanga.

00:26:21.762 --> 00:26:25.709
Jackie Abott even lifted him
with only a towel on his waist.

00:26:28.514 --> 00:26:29.466
- Fantasy.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.235
- Do you have pictures of those?

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:32.436
Sadly, there was no picture of that.

00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:37.123
It really depends
on the purpose of the role

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.668
of the imagined being.

00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:42.750
“Alright!”
Ate V once said.
