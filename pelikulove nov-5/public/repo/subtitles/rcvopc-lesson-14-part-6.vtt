WEBVTT - https://subtitletools.com

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.110
Well, let me start with
the center-based programs

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.646
being the artistic director
for the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:25.147
there're already platforms
dedicated to developing playwrights,

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.522
of course, it's not
Virgin Labfest obviously,

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.193
which is meant really--

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.505
it's a playwrights' festival
more than anything else.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.619
Putting the playwright
in the middle of this collaborative process

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:36.460
that we’ve been talking about

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.612
And hopefully,

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.471
which hasn’t happened yet
as much as we'd like to,

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:45.505
These plays are picked up
by professional theater groups

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.013
and make it part
of their repertoire.

00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:51.107
We aren't that successful yet
in that aspect

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:54.018
and that must be
investigated why somehow

00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:56.691
it hasn’t reached
that kind of dimension.

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:59.504
But definitely, VLF
has produced and honed

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:03.195
a whole new
generation of writers

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.096
who’ve written one-acts
and full-lengths, and even moved on to

00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:10.980
television and film scriptwriting
and enrich its whole world.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.325
VLF now is planning
to go regional

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:20.742
trying to establish
a VLF in Cagayan De Oro

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:28.335
to have a platform
for non-Tagalog writers,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.715
other languages like Bisaya,
Ilonggo, and so forth.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.939
That's one.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.681
Second, we have what we call
the intertextual division.

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:44.041
It used to be called
the literature division

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.178
but we chose to make it intertextual.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:49.765
The idea is literature,
but since it's a performing arts center,

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.938
it needs to interact
with performing arts

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:54.038
like music, theater, dance.

00:01:54.279 --> 00:02:01.966
The written word has iterations
as spoken word, as multimedia performances.

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:11.061
There's the possibility
of something written to be performed

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:15.179
and interacting with different
performing art forms.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:18.005
Third, our resident companies are there.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.031
Specifically, Tanghalang Pilipino
which is supposedly

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:28.347
one of our groups
that should be able to mount original work.

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:34.359
Again, it's a bit lacking
because of the budget

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.961
and the number of plays
they can mount in a year

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:41.330
so their choices
also become very limited

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:44.441
in terms of,
from picking up from new works.

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:48.870
But definitely, the road
should lead there

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:55.282
in terms of new works,
whether one-act or full length.

00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.314
Of course, publications,
we have the anthologies,

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:07.246
and at some point in the pipeline,
we're looking at online scripts.

00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.520
Making available these VLF scripts

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.942
online for people to access.

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:21.627
We’re trying to start the PETA laboratory
which is every September.

00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:23.283
We’re trying to do that.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:27.233
It's not just for playwrights
it's kinda like a multi-disciplinary

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:28.620
It can be different.

00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:31.833
- It can be dance, it can be whatever you--
- Devised work.

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:34.836
Devised, so it's not just one thing,
but that's one platform.

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:39.167
I had this conversation
the other day

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.724
and sometimes I think the reason

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.158
some of the stories aren't brought
to the bigger companies

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:46.214
because for PETA,

00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:49.313
the ones we've produced,
have to be in a bigger place

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.007
and VLF was already
conceptualized as a small play

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.361
and to expand it
would really take time.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:59.254
Going back to the idea of time,

00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:04.286
we might need to,

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:07.640
in commissioned works,
have new playwrights,

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.247
and as Rody said,
give them more time to develop it

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:14.241
and no harassing
them whatsoever.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.257
What happens
when we're short on time,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.564
the senior writers step up
because I don't have time anymore.

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:26.490
This thing has got to be fixed
so Rody steps in, something like that.

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:28.796
I do understand.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.833
I think it's really a question
of this possibility

00:04:32.858 --> 00:04:36.179
to have more time
to develop the work.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.660
Because if its going to enter
the season at the PETA,

00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:43.556
you’re really investing
money in it and everything

00:04:43.613 --> 00:04:45.119
and since we're not subsidized.

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:46.864
We have to recover
that money back.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.864
There are things
that are given.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:51.585
But what I want to do is,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.670
I believe that you can develop
an audience for anything,

00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:56.001
I'd like to believe that.

00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:59.378
In the same way that we developed
an audience for other stuff.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.733
I really think there
should really be a window

00:05:01.797 --> 00:05:04.183
to do these plays
that you’re doing,

00:05:04.247 --> 00:05:08.469
plays from VLF,
the text you like and so on.

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.346
But it's really funded,

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:15.423
you're given real money,
real time to rehearse, lengthy runs,

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:18.378
until you build an audience
that will come

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:22.674
and I think they will,
but you also need to invest in it.

00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:27.101
I hope over time
we find ways to balance that.

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:28.887
Hopefully, do that to the lab.

00:05:28.993 --> 00:05:32.021
I want it to be regular and longer.
So that’s the objective.

00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:36.042
And also, how do we access
these writers for our other projects?

00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:37.207
Let’s say,

00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:44.079
for the arts for democracy project
that we want to get into this coming year

00:05:44.182 --> 00:05:47.112
We want to work
with the regional theaters

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.636
and they should be creating
their own plays.

00:05:49.692 --> 00:05:54.972
How can we access your writers?
So they can work with the groups.

00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:59.404
So we can also connect them
with different activities already

00:05:59.611 --> 00:06:04.073
So they have platforms to write for.

00:06:04.616 --> 00:06:06.864
In a university,
can it be written by,

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.784
like a university theater festival
and all the writers are from VLF

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.541
We could have
that kind of thing

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.923
These guys are sometimes
semi-professional already

00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:20.207
they're not all
fresh off the mold,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.445
but they’re working with
the student groups.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:27.598
That's the creative work,
it's like a university festival.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.059
I think its also thinking
up of ways where

00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:33.833
we can put writers in
particular platforms.

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:37.861
I always say this, I think if

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:40.303
Rody and Lisa have become
the writers they are

00:06:40.387 --> 00:06:42.463
it's because their work
have been produced.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.920
I mean it's not because
they were born perfect,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.731
So they had to undergo a process,
but still had the time to write.

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.165
But they wrote and got produced.

00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:59.303
So that’s my dream,
I really want to be able to contribute,

00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:02.553
to create spaces for writers
because I really believe

00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.225
you need to be produced.
That’s the only way.

00:07:05.256 --> 00:07:08.989
Even if you fail it doesn’t matter
because you need to fail.

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:11.149
You need to see
your work up there.

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:14.141
If it doesn’t work,
well let’s move on, next video.

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.654
That’s the dream of how
can we get these guys to be produced,

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:21.784
It doesn’t have to be
a big production all the time.

00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:23.784
But I think you should see
what you invested in,

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:27.809
with the design, the actors,
with a time or period, like that.

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.012
I hope we can find
platforms for it in VLF.

00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:35.699
but I'll try within the framework
of PETA to make more space for you guys.

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.887
Sipat Lawin Ensemble is a company

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:45.095
that initiates programs,
projects for independent makers

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.501
who don't have
institutional backing

00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:51.789
or don't have the usual support
from big companies.

00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:59.216
2019 to 2021, the second installment
of Karnaval Festival will be released.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.855
It's a performance
and social innovation performance.

00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:07.888
If VLF is a festival for playwrights,

00:08:07.913 --> 00:08:12.376
Karnaval is a platform
for prototyping new works

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:16.017
where writers and creators
from the different arts come together.

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:18.094
We do some matchmaking.

00:08:18.157 --> 00:08:22.722
Then there's Lagablab
Artist Residency Project.

00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:27.644
where various artists and writers
have the opportunity to work with non-artists,

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:31.715
for example, anthropologists
who need a board, or architects

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:33.515
Is this a grant or no?

00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:35.427
Yes, it's grant-based.

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:39.426
Because we're an independent company,
whatever grant we get,

00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:42.838
we share it to those
who can't access grants

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.899
because they don't have
files for the registration.

00:08:46.924 --> 00:08:49.297
- Right.
- That's what we do.

00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:52.163
Sometimes, space is really important.

00:08:52.253 --> 00:08:55.964
The space and the people involved,
that's what's important.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.039
So there'll be regional hubs.

00:08:59.103 --> 00:09:02.702
There's a regional residency
in Mindoro and one in Baguio,

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:06.723
which is where you'll do
your work for a week or two.

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:09.543
But it needs to be funded
so that's what we're looking for.

00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:15.148
Artist education
along with audience education

00:09:15.205 --> 00:09:18.015
for the development of new works
were mentioned earlier.

00:09:18.952 --> 00:09:26.617
The practices of emerging artists
are documented in their early years.

00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:28.302
It's a documented series.

00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:32.097
You can learn about various processes,
especially by contemporaries.

00:09:32.122 --> 00:09:35.019
They say it's mostly
generational work.

00:09:35.044 --> 00:09:38.892
But that's what we do,
we document artists

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:42.324
who might eventually stop
because there's no support for their works

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:44.069
but there's still interest
in the processes.

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:46.794
And that's what we encourage
once an online database is put up.

00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:48.558
People could learn from them.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:53.048
And there's a blank-ticketed
informal school.

00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:59.551
We have a blank-ticket university
based on your socio-economic capacity,

00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:01.628
It depends on how much
you can afford.

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:06.724
It's an informal school for artists,
and writers, and devisers

00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:12.831
where you can study basic education,
such as history, arts theory, and so on.

00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:19.210
Our experience with various artists
started either from entertainment or--

00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.617
they're really good singers
but they actually want to write or direct.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:24.942
But how?

00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:28.469
It's difficult to enter UP
or the opportunity's pretty scarce.

00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:30.840
At the same time,
they "want to do a feminist play"

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:33.522
but when you look at it,
it's very sexist.

00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:37.729
With the basic things,
I realized I was privileged.

00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:41.374
Other artists have the education.

00:10:41.472 --> 00:10:43.005
To make that available--

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.505
even understanding
history, society is important.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.738
Those are the platforms, residencies

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:55.307
where opportunities are
since development takes three years.

00:10:55.394 --> 00:10:57.200
On the first year,
you pitch a work.

00:10:57.295 --> 00:10:59.087
On the second year,
it gets developed.

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:01.746
And on the third year,
it could be produced.

00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:04.963
So writers working
with non-writers,

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.754
we encourage this
kind of transmedia and intermedia.
