00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.052
We're at the final episode
of the online course

00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:19.791
so I thought of inviting

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:25.348
my director and actor friends
along with the course participants

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.770
to talk about, I guess,

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:34.293
the next phase in writing a play.

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:40.869
Like I said, writing
doesn't end with the first draft.

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:43.453
It has to become a production

00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:48.805
since it's the biggest
objective of a script.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.995
It's not for publication,
though it could be published,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.205
but the final goal
is for it to be performed.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.344
Therefore, it needs some help
from a director and from actors

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:09.234
so I invited Maribel,
JK, and Chris,

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:16.541
who are well-known
for directing plays,

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.455
and some known artists

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:24.723
in theater and film,
Angeli and Ross.

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:27.375
Welcome!

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.866
Good day!

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:35.817
Participants Maynard, J-mee,
and Dingdong are here as well.

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:41.442
They've been with me
in this entire journey.

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.167
I invited all of you

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:49.698
because many
beginning playwrights

00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:54.670
don't know what to do
after writing a play.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:02:00.061
I wanted to ask you all
as directors, and also as actors,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.995
what do you look for

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.178
in new original work?
What will excite you?

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:10.178
Not only in terms of topic,
but also in terms of style,

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.306
style of writing,
of language, and so on.

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:15.693
Maybe we could start from there.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.719
Actually, I've been quite fortunate

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:22.547
since I get to hear
the ideas first before the script.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.088
The story's discussed with me
even before the script is written.

00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:37.003
There's already a collaboration
from idea to story development.

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:38.423
That's exciting to me

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:43.575
because even before the words
are put on paper,

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:47.245
there's already engagement
with the directors early on

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.371
so somehow the visions

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.686
of the two major collaborators
are already melded together.

00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:55.653
I've been very lucky because

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:57.311
I've been working
with playwrights

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:59.227
who are very open to
that kind of process.

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.356
- Because you're also a playwright.
- Yes.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:10.055
Being one also helped
since I understand the process.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.025
Going back to your question,
what excites me to begin with a story?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.424
It's offering something important.

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:26.232
It's a waste of hours
or even years of development

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:29.118
if what I want to do
doesn't have meaning.

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.008
It needs to say
something important.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:38.487
And you need to have some
personal engagement with the story.

00:03:38.512 --> 00:03:39.815
You have a stake there.

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:44.842
It should somehow touch a certain core
of your beliefs and emotions,

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:48.774
or even personal stories
that could contribute to the story.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:53.085
And I guess, as a director,
as a storyteller,

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:56.810
it's important that you commit
to the story early on.

00:03:56.835 --> 00:04:01.128
Or you can also reverse the process

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.408
since the script
hasn't been written yet.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.789
It's possible for the script
to fall on your lap

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:09.224
and you read it
and you know.

00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:14.843
My work as a theater director
mostly revolves around devised new works

00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:20.732
so I see texts or scripts
as one of the devices in performance.

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:25.669
But there are shows like Virgin Labfest
where you're given a script

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:28.136
and that script is the end goal.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:36.123
Whenever I read a finished script,
I always look for two things.

00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:40.063
One's the “everydayness”
of the representation.

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:47.252
I'm a trained actor and I studied acting,
its history and whatnot.

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:49.539
There are theatrical truths

00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:54.746
where we develop habits in theater
such as "magnanimous truths".

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:56.392
To the point where

00:04:56.936 --> 00:05:00.211
our metaphors have changed,

00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:03.132
the performance
of our identities has changed,

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:05.024
the manner of speech
has changed,

00:05:05.802 --> 00:05:08.650
and even the psyche
of the general public has changed.

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.958
As a contemporary performance maker,
those are what I look for,

00:05:11.983 --> 00:05:14.189
the overall sense of “everydayness”.

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.703
Of the present day?

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:20.921
If that's the milieu
or setting of the play.

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:26.641
Second is point of view
or points of view.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.203
Nowadays, I'm more interested
in the idea of pluralities,

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:36.057
the plurality of meaning-making,
and where I can step in.

00:05:36.173 --> 00:05:40.602
Does the script provide a gap
that the audience can pick up from?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.985
What point of view
am I seeing for the first time?

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:47.989
Is this the first time someone articulated
something for me and the audience?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.502
That's what I'm looking for.

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:53.917
Otherwise, it's either "I've felt this before"
or "I've said this before"

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.584
I'm done with that.

00:05:55.845 --> 00:06:01.508
Well, my treatment for scripts,
if there is a script in this process,

00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:04.242
is that it's literature
first and foremost.

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:06.830
I'm stubborn as a director.

00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:09.237
I don't edit literature.

00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:11.615
So what I do is,
and playwrights know this,

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:13.489
I stage it first if it's a one-act.

00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:14.985
As much as possible, I don't--

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.144
I'm stubborn in a sense
because I stick with the text.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.999
And those kinds of directors
are uncommon.

00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:22.187
Most directors edit
the script they're given

00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:26.375
because how they perceive
or materialize it is different.

00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:31.156
There are directors like me who say,
"Okay, let's lift it from the page,"

00:06:31.337 --> 00:06:34.961
"Let's see and add elements like this,
and a different point of view."

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.504
But what's important is,

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:41.729
let's say there's a house
with an open window

00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:44.962
where I can come in,
a designer can come in as well.

00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:49.617
If there are gaps
that we could go into.

00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:52.848
At PETA more often than not,
it's usually commissioned work.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.387
This means we already had
a discussion with the writer.

00:06:56.412 --> 00:07:00.063
Whatever that play is
or its content.

00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:04.439
PETA is very content-heavy
and content-driven

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.548
But to me I guess
it doesn’t really matter.

00:07:09.573 --> 00:07:11.825
If I read a script,
it’s always, "What's the story?"

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.533
"What’s the narrative?
Is it new? Is it interesting?"

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:17.451
"Does it interest me whatsoever?"

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:20.649
If after the third page,
it's already a snooze fest,

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.082
or like, "What is this?"

00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:24.415
Third page?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.055
- No, but I’m good ah.
- Woah, pressure.

00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:31.394
I'm good ah,
I read to the very end.

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:35.258
I remember Soxy telling me,
"Don't finish that."

00:07:35.283 --> 00:07:37.772
"If you're on page 3 or 4
and you don't like it ,"

00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:40.051
"Just drop it."

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.798
I still finish it, but

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:47.237
you can already tell
with the tempo or feel, 3-4 pages in.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.068
It’s important
that something excites me,

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:51.945
it doesn’t have to be perfect.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:55.514
But as I’m reading,
I need to see images

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:59.367
since I'm the director, right?
So the goal is to visualize it.

00:07:59.392 --> 00:08:04.219
What has excited you
in previous plays that you’ve read?

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.384
When I read your “Kafatiran”
(to Dingdong),

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:10.008
I liked it just to be
as immediate as possible.

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:12.461
She was a reader
for Virgin Labfest one time.

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:15.313
During that time,
when I read his play,

00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:17.272
he was one of the few--

00:08:19.093 --> 00:08:22.462
You become engaged
when you read it.

00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:26.436
I'm really shallow.
I mean I like funny scripts.

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:30.723
I like sort of real--
I mean if it's stylized, stylized.

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:34.834
But for me, it's got to be
always rooted in reality.

00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:38.002
I don't like reading plays
that make me go, "Was this researched?"

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.443
It should be grounded, rooted
in the kind of truth and reality that's--

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:47.570
Of course, I’m always looking
for what the playwright wants to say

00:08:47.817 --> 00:08:50.284
and do I agree with it?
Or will PETA?

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:54.338
‘Cause I’m artistic director for PETA.
Will PETA agree with this point of view?

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.275
And that’s very important for us.

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:01.024
I love working with original work.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:04.164
I do. All my life I think
that’s what I really know

00:09:04.189 --> 00:09:06.592
how to do because
the journey is great.

00:09:07.438 --> 00:09:10.149
You journey together with the writer
and you don’t know what’s going to happen.

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:12.060
That’s what I love.
It’s like either...

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:15.761
it's two things for me,
either what I'll do is bad or good

00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:18.779
because in between is mediocre
and that's forgettable.

00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:23.879
So I'd rather be extremely bad or good
because you know what I mean?

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:26.668
For people to talk about it.

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:31.617
They backstab you,
but become friendly in front of you.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.320
I just think that that’s the best part
about original work

00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:39.481
because you don’t really know.

00:09:39.653 --> 00:09:42.236
We (with J-mee) were discussing
in the car on the way here

00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:46.715
I told her it's really important for me,
you know my Tagalog isn’t great.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.338
So for me, it’s more important
when we read.

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:51.325
I love reading
and I hear the actors

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.924
because that will set
the kind of rhythm,

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:57.195
you can see the quality of the words
and language of the writer.

00:09:57.357 --> 00:09:58.301
And you need to hear it

00:09:58.326 --> 00:10:00.303
because at the end of the day,
it’s a performance, right?

00:10:00.328 --> 00:10:01.077
But for me--

00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:04.031
because I want to put it
on stage I need to hear the--

00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:05.770
that’s the first way I want to hear it.

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:09.003
Like a cadence, a sound,
how the words ring with each other.

00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:13.081
So I need the use of words,
to me, is also very, very important.

00:10:13.106 --> 00:10:14.614
The language.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.474
And can I visualize stuff as I’m reading?
Do they turn into images?

00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:24.000
For the actors, of course,

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.784
if you're given a script

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.909
the role is offered
to you and so on.

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:38.875
What do you look for
before agreeing to do it?

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:49.042
- We were trained to read the play as is.
-The whole, as is.

00:10:49.155 --> 00:10:53.070
Not from the point of view
of the character or anything.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:59.563
From there, if the story itself
resonates with me,

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:01.522
then I'm interested,

00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:06.945
regardless if it's a lead role,
supporting role or a passerby,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.163
If it’s a good story,
we want to do it.

00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:16.162
What's usually a good story for you?
Or resonates with you?

00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:26.452
Well first, it has to be familiar,
but at the same time totally different.

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:28.799
If that makes sense.

00:11:28.824 --> 00:11:31.214
Same, same,
but different as they say.

00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.541
In a way, you could still relate

00:11:34.566 --> 00:11:40.656
but it's better because
you haven't experienced it yet.

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:41.997
Something like that.

00:11:42.022 --> 00:11:45.574
How interesting would this be?
I think I understand it.

00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:53.211
There's a lot that could be done,
but it's not within my experiences

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:55.604
or I haven't done anything like it.

00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:56.781
Something like that.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.607
Those are the first thoughts I get
after reading something.

00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:07.768
If it's saying something important,

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.605
like what Sir Chris said,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.128
if it's saying something important,

00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:16.250
it could be the most
ordinary story in the world,

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:18.837
but if it's saying
something important,

00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:20.092
then I want to do it.

00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:21.598
How about you, Ross?

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:27.108
In my case,

00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:32.152
as a newbie,
I'm fairly new to acting

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:35.132
I want to--

00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:36.417
Weren't you a child star?

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.097
The plays I want to act in,

00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:49.320
for example, are those

00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:53.065
with a character I anchor to

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.284
and whose story I follow through

00:12:57.854 --> 00:12:59.359
from beginning to end.

00:13:02.926 --> 00:13:07.000
Plays that don't spell everything out,

00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:16.905
but the choices made
by the character are wild

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.598
throughout the story.

00:13:18.623 --> 00:13:22.065
I like it when it makes me think
"Oh, this is possible."

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.695
So when I see something
like that in the script,

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:27.570
- I want to do it.
- It excites you.

00:13:27.782 --> 00:13:29.670
It's totally new to me.

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:36.183
What we like are those
that take us out of our comfort zone.

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:40.336
When you're not
in your comfort zone,

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:47.979
you become more open
to other possible choices.

00:13:49.742 --> 00:13:53.263
You were saying something
important that really strikes you.

00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:55.313
What does that mean?

00:13:55.338 --> 00:14:00.927
What's important to you
as directors? as actors?

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:10.508
When it articulates something new
that's very distinct, very unique to the times.

00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:12.131
That's one.

00:14:12.156 --> 00:14:13.324
So, political?

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:17.331
It could be political,
let's say me as a gay man.
222
00:16:04,034 --> 00:14:18,525
For example,

00:14:18.864 --> 00:14:22.430
I feel like I haven't been
totally represented.

00:14:22.702 --> 00:14:28.665
On how I speak,
the complexities of my identity online.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.680
I code switch from Tagalog to English,
those kinds of things.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.733
What's new after a long history
of meaning-making in theater?

00:14:38.758 --> 00:14:41.115
What are the new things
we say today?

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.724
- What's important?

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:47.437
What's important for me now,
especially specific to now,

00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.308
is to hear what's
on the other side of the wall.

00:14:50.937 --> 00:14:53.598
Most of the time, I feel like
we're in an echo chamber.

00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:54.893
That's my judgment now.

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:57.261
We perform in an echo chamber

00:14:57.286 --> 00:15:00.515
or people who
usually agree with us

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.200
are people who go to the theater.

00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:04.918
They're the people
who remain throughout the years.

00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:05.722
We educate them.

00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:09.467
But there are people
on the other side of the wall

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.717
whose perspectives
I haven't heard of.

00:15:11.742 --> 00:15:14.012
The unconverted,
something like that?

00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:17.107
The unconverted,
or caricatures in our point of view.

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:21.977
So that's what I'm looking for now.
It's not as simple as a populist thing.

00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:26.586
Parents, relatives,
they're people we know.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.789
There's something there
that I feel like I haven't heard of yet.

00:15:29.884 --> 00:15:33.618
That's the challenge everytime.

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:37.992
Outside what we know,

00:15:38.017 --> 00:15:42.110
all of us in this room agree
that it's what's on the other side

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:45.095
that needs to be onstage.

00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:51.501
Basically the same.

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:59.125
When you say important,
we should immediately look at our stories.

00:15:59.696 --> 00:16:03.554
The areas we should be looking at
are history or folk tales

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:07.460
that people don't know of

00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:12.109
because what's written
in the history books are full of gaps.

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:14.380
And sometimes point of views.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.613
Some stories have been told
so many times

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:20.736
that when a new point
of view comes along,

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:23.314
it opens up an old situation

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:26.009
that will give us new lessons
and new perspectives.

00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:32.195
To me that should be
an important story to follow through.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.658
For personal stories,

00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:43.971
again, I like stories
that seem invisible.

00:16:46.293 --> 00:16:50.172
We see it everyday,
but don't talk about or dissect it.

00:16:50.197 --> 00:16:52.970
- Like there's no voice.
- Voiceless.

00:16:58.796 --> 00:17:04.074
Voiceless characters have been
appealing to me ever since.

00:17:05.036 --> 00:17:07.227
Even the first play I wrote,
"Buwan at Baril,"

00:17:07.252 --> 00:17:11.823
was practically giving a voice
to what was rendered invisible then

00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:13.775
because they were underground.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.482
Somehow that has been
appealing to me all throughout.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:22.645
The idea of looking for stories
that give voice to the voiceless.

00:17:23.295 --> 00:17:27.956
For me, nowadays,

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:35.191
being judgmental
has been prevalent in social media.

00:17:35.216 --> 00:17:40.651
Just by reading a headline
with "Duterte" on it,

00:17:41.086 --> 00:17:42.809
people already start to judge.

00:17:42.922 --> 00:17:47.283
The script's importance for me

00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:51.292
is for people to see
the thought process of characters

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:59.237
who you can't judge at face-value
if they dress or act this way.

00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:02.127
For people to see
why they do the things they do.

00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:05.102
Why do they do this certain action?

00:18:08.396 --> 00:18:10.817
That's my take on it.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.930
For people to see
the reason behind every action.

00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:19.602
It's not a headline,
not the tip of the iceberg

00:18:19.627 --> 00:18:23.981
so they can see

00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:27.073
- The deeper--
- Where the action came from.

00:18:27.645 --> 00:18:28.749
- Can I add to that?

00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:35.724
Like what you said,
just going deeper I suppose,

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:40.619
when people reduce an issue,
I guess, under the microscope,

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:44.435
that's what's important
to me as well.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:52.014
When people personally feel
that it's not important to bring to light,

00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:55.923
but sometimes
the smallest decisions we make are--

00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:59.574
it causes a ripple effect,
it affects the bigger picture.

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:03.194
As you said, there's a voice
outside the wall.

00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:11.164
There's really no
black and white, right?

00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:16.014
That's also what we want
to come across, I suppose.

00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:21.452
We have to see that nobody--
I'm really going to say it?

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.695
That there really isn't a "villain".

00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:31.352
Maybe we think there are
because we don't agree with them.

00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:33.571
But if we get to see

00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:37.549
the personal stuff
behind their decision,

00:19:37.574 --> 00:19:39.045
then we will see

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:43.601
that they're just human beings
like everyone else.

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:46.076
Fallible and all that.

00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:51.201
And I think that's interesting
to write about and talk about.

00:19:51.578 --> 00:19:52.713
How about you?

00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:55.723
I will argue that point of view.

00:19:57.506 --> 00:20:00.626
For certain--
I think basically it's that.

00:20:00.807 --> 00:20:03.175
I mean, Like Chris and I -- same.

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:05.492
It should be something,
a source from our times

00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:07.286
that's relevant and important.

00:20:07.428 --> 00:20:13.180
I think that's what's important for--
because it's the way we tell stories.

00:20:13.205 --> 00:20:14.236
The choices that we make.

00:20:15.307 --> 00:20:17.897
The sophisticated
point of view in storytelling

00:20:17.922 --> 00:20:20.560
whether it's like that,
really fleshing out

00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:22.227
everybody's motivation

00:20:22.252 --> 00:20:25.538
so we see that we're all
coming from places of truth

00:20:25.574 --> 00:20:27.358
and not stereotypes.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.843
But I guess--
how that works out,

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:33.582
who wins or who loses
or which of the argument.

00:20:33.724 --> 00:20:38.062
I believe there has to be
an argument that matters more,

00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:42.227
We can't just be blameless,
or say "we're just human"

00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:44.862
because all our actions
have repercussions

00:20:44.887 --> 00:20:49.312
and some repercussions
are really dangerous.

00:20:49.337 --> 00:20:50.959
And I guess, I don't want to--

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:55.199
obviously, I'd like
to make interesting theater

00:20:55.224 --> 00:20:57.730
irregardless if we’re
content-heavy or whatever.

00:20:57.807 --> 00:21:02.345
The sophistication of the writer,
the philosophies and ideas behind it.

00:21:02.448 --> 00:21:04.812
You can read it,
I think from his words

00:21:04.837 --> 00:21:08.652
his choices of scenes,
the clashing of things,

00:21:08.677 --> 00:21:12.270
that's where you'll see
the writer's sophistication of thought.

00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:17.969
Sometimes, I get to read this,
yes, there's content, but it's too weak.

00:21:17.994 --> 00:21:18.872
Makes me want to say,

00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:23.084
"Hija, study more or expand
your real understanding--"

00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:23.836
- Her worldview.

00:21:23.863 --> 00:21:24.999
Yeah, her worldview.

00:21:25.023 --> 00:21:29.391
so the arguments
are rich inside, on both sides.

00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:33.116
As writers, you're supposed
to argue for both sides.

00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:34.723
Actually, that's what makes it rich.

00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:40.125
So what we're looking for
is the richness of argument that happens.

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.231
I'll go back to the new work.

00:21:42.256 --> 00:21:46.136
Sometimes, that also gets added on
during rehearsals.

00:21:46.161 --> 00:21:48.122
‘Cause that can also
be something that,

00:21:48.147 --> 00:21:49.352
based on your work.

00:21:49.377 --> 00:21:53.145
The actors can either
improvise on or expand-

00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:55.985
and you guys come in
and sort of clean it up.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.277
because the actors
have been working on the piece.

00:21:58.302 --> 00:22:02.373
So that’s the beauty
of being able to keep on--

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:03.684
working at the script

00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:06.038
because then you can
really expand it.

00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:08.009
I'm sure that it also helps you

00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:10.025
to hear the words out loud

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.258
and to see the actors

00:22:11.283 --> 00:22:13.133
are moving it
and speaking it

00:22:13.842 --> 00:22:19.380
Those sophisticated arguments--

00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:20.927
can be further developed.

00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:31.249
based on your work.

00:22:31.302 --> 00:22:35.042
the actors can either
improvise on or expand

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:37.805
and you guys come in
and sort of clean it up

00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:40.088
because the actors
have been working on the piece.

00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:44.155
So that’s the beauty
of being able to keep on

00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:47.703
working at the script
because then you can really expand it.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.274
Okay, let's reverse the mirror.

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:59.089
Maybe it'd be good to ask you
(playwrights) what you expect.

00:22:59.243 --> 00:23:01.642
So the script's been
submitted and accepted,

00:23:01.682 --> 00:23:05.399
and JA, Chris, and
Angeli are excited.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.230
What kind of process
do you expect?

00:23:08.397 --> 00:23:12.611
Because the usual attitude,

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:15.528
well not usual, it’s
not really usual

00:23:15.893 --> 00:23:20.635
one attitudes of the playwright is,
"Here it is, it's up to you."

00:23:20.802 --> 00:23:21.993
"Surprise me."

00:23:26.564 --> 00:23:32.658
What kind of relationship
do you expect with the director,

00:23:32.698 --> 00:23:35.898
with the actors,
and with the whole production?

00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:40.648
When I write or if it's
a commissioned work,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.568
I alwayssee my script
as a proposal.

00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:45.944
It's like submitting
my personal proposal

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.604
to those people there.

00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:51.198
I see it as a collaborative process.

00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:54.587
I'm not saying
my script's the bible.

00:23:54.675 --> 00:23:58.851
I know there are still
a lot of gaps in between

00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:00.041
because I'm just one writer.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.999
I believe the director's pulse
is important.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.573
As it is being produced,

00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:07.337
I just hope they look
at what works.

00:24:07.393 --> 00:24:10.010
I'm kind of expecting

00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:12.407
to be part of the process

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:15.027
in terms of the
actors' rehearsal,

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:17.060
and they have
something to contribute.

00:24:17.907 --> 00:24:20.319
In order to clean it up,
to improve, to argue

00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:24.418
why you think this works or not,
then we try to include it.

00:24:25.021 --> 00:24:29.666
I see the text as something
open in the first part.

00:24:29.716 --> 00:24:30.897
We can still work on it

00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:34.813
with the help of the actors,
directors, production designer.

00:24:35.376 --> 00:24:39.069
Only after it's mounted or formed

00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:42.272
can we say if it needs
improving or not.

00:24:42.424 --> 00:24:46.001
I see the text or the script
as a never-ending—

00:24:46.363 --> 00:24:50.308
not really never-ending,
but a process-driven

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:54.156
kind of meaning-making
or art-making.

00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:59.239
I like that collaborative process
with the director and with the actors.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.104
Especially the actors,
they will really

00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:04.796
anchor themselves
on one particular character,

00:25:04.852 --> 00:25:07.480
whether it’s their character
that they’re doing

00:25:07.528 --> 00:25:10.955
or they’re just reading
for that particular session,

00:25:11.305 --> 00:25:15.734
where there're a lot of questions
like “Where did this line come from?”

00:25:16.744 --> 00:25:18.736
which would also make
the writers wonder.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.675
And it could really change
the whole script.

00:25:22.716 --> 00:25:25.933
Is it like defending
your thesis or something?

00:25:26.037 --> 00:25:29.076
Defend, but you're open to--

00:25:29.452 --> 00:25:31.868
To suggestions and ideas.

00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:34.072
Sometimes you'll see

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.890
from version 1 to version 8.

00:25:35.947 --> 00:25:39.736
Or even to version 2
there'd be huge changes.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:50.085
It’s all with trust that they’re all
contributing to make this a better work.

00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:52.844
It's also a bit
ego-crushing, isn't it?

00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:56.200
The fact that you worked hard on it
for so many months,

00:25:56.238 --> 00:25:59.134
and when they read it,
"Why's it like this?"

00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:01.876
"Can we change this part
'cause I don't understand it..."

00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:07.229
So you feel that there's something
that you really have to set aside.
