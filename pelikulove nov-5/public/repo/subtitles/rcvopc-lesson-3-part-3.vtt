00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.448
What if someone asks you

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.461
What about historical characters?

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:21.003
Or real people based on a true story,
for example?

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:26.001
These are real people
and they have biographies.

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.089
Some biographies are so thick
since they did a lot of things.

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:33.176
Now how will you translate that,

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:37.499
or you just won't dramatize their life
onstage or on film or whatever?

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:43.998
What I always say is that
you're not reviving the person herself,

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:49.781
just the memories
or what we know of that person.

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:51.740
Since she's dead,

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:54.840
and we've already
summed up her experiences.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.575
For example,
she had brilliant contributions

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.109
that's why you chose
to write about her.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:04.730
That's what we reinforce,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.234
and if that's what
you want to dramatize

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:11.967
that'll be the context
of the whole play.

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:20.807
If you notice, there are many plays and films
about Jose Rizal, for example.

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.861
Rizal's life is pretty complicated.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:29.227
There's Rizal who threw his slipper
when he was young,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.743
Rizal who listened to his mother's story
about a moth,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.539
but there's also a
Rizal in Europe

00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:44.984
who wrote a novel
and fought with fellow Illustrados

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:51.041
for freedom and denouncement of the friars,

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.086
but there's also a Rizal in Dapitan,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.746
a Rizal who fell in love
with Josephine Bracken,

00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:04.250
a Rizal who fell in love
with Leonor Rivera,

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:13.336
and a Rizal who fought
to maintain their land in Calamba.

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:18.128
All of this is just one person.

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:21.402
Now if you dramatize that,

00:02:23.182 --> 00:02:26.810
it might take a month
to show his life

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:31.270
Since he lived for 35 years.

00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:33.826
What's a month, right?

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:39.817
So what'll happen
is you have to select

00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:46.175
what's significant to the story
you're writing about Rizal.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.283
And since you did that,

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.324
you didn't bring
the real person back.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.846
I don't know anyone
other than Jesus who can do that.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:04.314
You made Rizal into a character
because the real Rizal is dead.

00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:08.530
Since you made him
into a character,

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:16.884
it doesn't mean he won't
seem like a 3D character.

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:22.118
You'll create an illusion.

00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:23.986
This is where your magic comes in.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:36.388
How will you make him feel real
without acquiring all his actual traits?

00:03:37.973 --> 00:03:41.678
The most important thing
is for you to choose

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:49.880
what will help in making
Rizal's story progress.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.161
Rizal's childhood experience
about the moth story could be included.

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:04.536
He could remember that memory
standing before the firing squad.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.643
Because it'd be weird
if at that moment

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:15.397
what he remembered was his memory
about the slipper he threw out the ship.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:20.755
It's not relevant to the situation.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:22.816
That's what I mean.

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:31.483
That's why it should be clear to you,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.270
the difference between the two,

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:36.859
character and human being.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.257
I'll give you an example,

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:43.892
I assume you also watch films,

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:48.249
from one historical character,

00:04:48.463 --> 00:04:49.862
Emilio Aguinaldo.

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:54.115
There have been
several films made

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.388
where he was shown,
not necessarily as the protagonist.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:58.946
Although there are films
where he's the protagonist.

00:04:58.972 --> 00:05:03.409
In fact, there's a musical
about his life,

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:07.365
and a play that Nick Joaquin wrote

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:17.135
where he exposed Aguinaldo's
deep relationship with his mother.

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:28.575
In all of the portrayals of Aguinaldo,
he was shown as an honorable man.

00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:38.211
The reason for the Philippine revolution's
victory and its collapse,

00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:42.588
which was also implied
to have not been his fault.

00:05:43.288 --> 00:05:46.052
His belief that it is for the country.

00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:52.282
But there are films
that show the complete opposite.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.494
In the films that depict him
as kind and noble,

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:04.331
they show other characters
who were allegedly his rivals

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.995
in a very negative light.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.467
For example, General Luna.

00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:18.084
He was depicted as someone
who had no qualms shooting anyone.

00:06:18.414 --> 00:06:26.600
While in the film that showed
Aguinaldo's weakness and depravity,

00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:33.736
General Luna's character
was portrayed as someone hotheaded,

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:40.135
but not someone who'd kill
innocent people without weapons.

00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:46.894
He killed a chicken in rage,
but not a person.

00:06:47.547 --> 00:06:51.613
In fact, it coud be that the writers
of those two versions

00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:55.731
only had one historical source as reference.

00:06:56.731 --> 00:07:01.581
A small anecdote that someone heard
that was interpreted differently.

00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:07.229
So we go back to the fact
that your material is already there.

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:18.754
And the writers' interpretation of it is what will manifest in their writing.

00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:20.854
So will it deviate
from the material?

00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:21.643
Not really.

00:07:21.834 --> 00:07:27.351
In fact, when it's based on a true story

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:31.392
you need to conduct research on it.

00:07:32.062 --> 00:07:37.356
And in your research,
you must find the different versions,

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.721
especially since there are many
versions of history.

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:42.594
Especially in Phillipine history.

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:45.442
There's a Bonifacio
who's very honorable,

00:07:45.486 --> 00:07:54.512
while there's a Bonifacio who's an
inventor and a conman and so on.

00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:56.050
There are many versions.

00:07:56.082 --> 00:08:01.369
Now if you're a dedicated writer,
you'll sift through everything.

00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:04.064
All the available source materials.

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:07.638
If there are relatives,
you have to interview them.

00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:09.995
From there,

00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:11.375
you'll figure out

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.246
what historical facts are,
more or less,

00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:19.578
what historical conjectures are,

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.222
and what are unknown.

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:26.859
The gap between
the conjecture and the unknown

00:08:26.928 --> 00:08:31.546
is where you can
make something up

00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:43.239
to connect one historical fact to another.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.303
That's not a diversion,
but an interpretation.

00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:53.985
For example, in the film “JFK,”

00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:59.822
there's a director who said

00:08:59.888 --> 00:09:03.360
this is what happened
to the president of America.

00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:06.540
He was the victim of a conspiracy.

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:12.583
In reality, there are many versions.

00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:18.860
There's a version
that will attack that perspective.

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:24.908
But that's the interpretation
that the film chose.

00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:26.036
It's the same

00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:31.225
whether this is Aguinaldo's film
or General Luna's film.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:38.932
The writer has
a position on the matter.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.135
And she will stand by that position.

00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:48.441
And that stance will strengthen
if she can convince the audience

00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:52.839
that what she showed is accurate

00:09:53.477 --> 00:10:00.668
or if the character
was depicted accurately.

00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:06.090
Again, it's important to know

00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:14.243
that characters in plays and films
are not real people.

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:19.581
Because if it's historical,
the actual people are already buried.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:27.174
What we'll see
are the different versions of the person.

00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:32.130
There's a bad aspect, a good aspect,

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:38.803
and there are excuses
and celebrations of honor.

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:40.289
It's the same with others,

00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:43.315
even if it's not historical
like a news event,

00:10:44.004 --> 00:10:48.193
even a story about a gangster

00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:54.092
or a couple who got into a bloodbath.

00:10:55.365 --> 00:11:01.274
What's most important
is the writer's interpretation of the story

00:11:01.316 --> 00:11:06.645
What else can she say
that hasn't been said before?
