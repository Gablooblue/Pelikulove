00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.894
Okay, now let's reverse the mirror.

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:23.676
Maybe it'd be good to ask you
(playwrights) what you expect.

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.102
So the script's been
submitted and accepted,

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:29.717
and JK, Chris, and
Angeli are excited.

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:32.465
What kind of process
do you expect?

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:37.118
Because the usual attitude,

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:40.029
well not usual,
it’s not really usual

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.670
some of the attitudes
of playwrights is,

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.007
"Here it is, it's up to you."

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:46.576
"Surprise me."

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:56.408
What kind of relationship--

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:57.606
do you expect
with the director,

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.217
with the actors and
with the whole production?

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.382
When I write or if it's a
comissioned work,

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:08.052
I always see
my script as a proposal.

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:10.609
It's like submitting my
personal proposal.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:12.171
to those people there.

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:15.897
I see it as a collaborative process.

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.135
I'm not saying
my script's the bible,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.644
I believe there are still
a lot of gaps in between

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.772
because I'm just one writer.

00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:27.609
I believe the director's pulse is important.

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:30.959
I just hope while working
on the script,

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:32.675
they look at what works
and what doesn't

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:37.753
I'm kind of expecting also
to be part of the process

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:40.003
in terms of the
actors' rehearsal,

00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:42.350
if there's something to contribute.

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.864
In order to clean it up,
to improve, to argue

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.610
why you think
this works or not,

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:49.832
then we input it on Word.

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:55.045
I see the text as something open
in the first part of the process.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.240
We can still work on it

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:57.802
with the help of the actors,

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:00.263
directors, production designer.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:04.457
Only after it's mounted or formed

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:07.706
can we say if it needs
improving or not.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.820
I see the text or the script

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:11.045
as a never-ending--

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.684
not really never-ending,
but a process-driven

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.815
kind of meaning-making
or art-making.

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.563
I like that collaborative process

00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:25.355
with the director
and with the actors.

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:26.541
Especially the actors,

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:29.360
they'd really anchor themselves

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:30.731
on one particular character,

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:33.218
whether it’s their
character that they’re doing

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:37.033
or they’re just reading
for that particular session,

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:39.663
where there's a lot
of questions like

00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:41.719
“Where did this line come from?”

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.179
which would also make
the writers wonder.

00:02:44.204 --> 00:02:48.728
And it could really change
the whole script.

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:52.087
Is it like defending
your thesis or something?

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:54.971
Defend, but you're open--

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.021
To suggestions and ideas.

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:01.757
Sometimes you'll see
from version 1 to version 8,

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:05.990
or even to version 2,
that there's already a huge change.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.332
It’s all with trust that they’re all
contributing to make this a better work.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.801
It's also a bit
ego-crushing, isn't it?

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.782
The fact that you worked hard on it
for so many months,

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:25.090
and when they read it,
"Why's it like this?"

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.990
"Can we change this part
'cause I don't understand it..."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.008
So you feel that there's something
that you really have to set aside.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.001
Do you have a negotiable,
a non-negotiable?

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:38.566
‘Cause I understand
when you’re a young writer,

00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.460
your tendency
is of course you want to...

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:44.550
Are there things in your script
that are non-negotiable?

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:48.140
Not non-negotiable,
but I think it’s clear to you

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.246
this is really the storytelling,
main things you want to say.

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.357
Is there anything like that?
Or are you completely open to it?

00:03:54.388 --> 00:03:56.989
If it's the main premise I sent.

00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:05.361
For example, a story
about a dog that ate something.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.247
If that's taken out,

00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:10.352
"That was the point,
why'd you take it out?"

00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:14.904
It's not supposed to be
an ego-crushing thing.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.601
Both sides are trying to--

00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:21.921
As a producer, a director,
I'm also trying to catch myself

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:25.520
I shouldn't be--
it should still be the writer.

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.080
We're there to improve on it
and make it better,

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:32.922
but I think it's still
the writer's text.

00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:37.363
And I think that’s what
I constantly try to remind myself

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:40.029
when we're working
that way, right?

00:04:40.054 --> 00:04:42.670
- To still honor the--
- The play.

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:45.295
At the end of the day,
your name should be there

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.556
because those ideas are yours.

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:51.653
It might also depend on the form.

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:53.978
The play form.
Like for example, straight plays.

00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:57.619
Writers have a bigger hand in it.

00:04:57.644 --> 00:05:01.876
For musicals,
music plays a large part,

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:07.021
especially the composer, book writer,
director, and choreographer.

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:11.069
Usually, changes occur
from the original story

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:12.728
that was conceived
by the writer.

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:15.785
In terms of director-writer relationship,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.752
you could bend
or stretch it a little,

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:22.328
but don't break the spine.

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.327
Don't break the spine,
otherwise, just write your own play.

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:32.486
I guess because you agreed,
why you said yes in first place.

00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:32.767
Yeah?

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:34.261
Speaking of ego-crushing,

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:38.933
we have an interesting dynamic.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.635
Of course we're excited
because it's our first play together.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.623
And we built our own characters.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:53.088
We talked about why
we did the play and so on

00:05:53.113 --> 00:06:00.484
She's a prostitute and I'm like
the town fool-turned-hitman.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.539
A vicious hitman.

00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:07.139
Because of the setting,
we humanized the characters

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:13.584
since we felt the setting
and the costumes were enough to--

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.766
Indicate?

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:19.756
Indicate the play's grotesqueness.

00:06:19.902 --> 00:06:24.023
So we felt our role was to
humanize our characters.

00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:27.362
So we did a run of the play.

00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.123
When it was time
for the company call

00:06:31.148 --> 00:06:32.189
with notes and all,

00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.967
"Okay, so it's like this,"

00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:39.839
"We liked how it turned out,"

00:06:39.864 --> 00:06:44.773
"But Ross uh,
Uod (my role) is just plain evil."

00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:47.586
Like Joker?

00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:52.783
They were just going for
of a needy character

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:56.162
so we just said "Okay."

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.208
But we were
sort of devastated

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:06.154
because the arc we built
for our characters were discarded.

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:08.454
The next day we rehearsed

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:12.676
everything totally changed.

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.414
So we just did
what we were told.

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:16.945
You mean the attack?

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:19.581
Everything!
Really everything.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.670
It felt like, now that I recall--

00:07:23.827 --> 00:07:25.256
It's coming back to you.

00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:33.357
It was presented as this
and we felt it was our job to--

00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:35.831
- Layer it?
- Yes, to layer it.

00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:38.445
And make it relatable at least,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.802
if not for the whole audience,
then for some people.

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:45.546
So when we were given
those instructions

00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:47.912
- Very linear.
- We couldn't understand

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:51.120
But now that I think about it, I think

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:56.583
that kind of style could really be
what the writer wanted to happen.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.626
We have to adapt with to the style.

00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.072
I think this is,
what Ross shared, just shows us

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:08.367
the very rich, but at the same time
dangerous terrain of collaboration.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.578
Dangerous in a wonderful way

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.343
because it turns out

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.635
the original work being worked on,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.822
is not a finished text
when it enters the rehearsal hall.

00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:20.577
It needs to be
opened up again.

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:21.420
Remember,

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:26.181
the moment you give that,
an original work or new work,

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:29.406
to a group of collaborators,
directors, actors,

00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:31.164
designers,
what-have-you,

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:34.463
it’s practically open
to multiple readings.

00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:37.535
The designer
visualizes her reading.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.169
The director makes an act
from her reading.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.277
The actor adds a layer as well.

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:47.197
And I think, presuming
that the playwright

00:08:48.213 --> 00:08:50.495
seizes the opportunity
to collaborate

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.797
and is open to collaborate
to begin with,

00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:57.388
I think it’s a wonderful start
of a creative process.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.630
After the text, I remember working
with Maynard and Dingdong,

00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:03.333
on "Kafatiran"
and "Symposium".

00:09:03.358 --> 00:09:06.273
When the text is there,
when the playwright is there,

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:11.077
my immediate task is to determine
the kind of suspension of disbelief needed.

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.043
Will we commit to this world
we're creating?

00:09:13.068 --> 00:09:16.696
The text will develop from there.
Subtexts will spring up.

00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:19.615
Sometimes, the director
or actors carry it out.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.977
It's always in consultation.

00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:27.143
For example, we we're given four
gay Katipuneros.

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:29.453
They need not be fleshed out,
they could just be gays for all we know.

00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:32.078
But the narrative
has a point of view.

00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:33.887
It could be based
on a research in the 1800s

00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:37.369
so the presentation
of femininity is different and so on.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.786
Dangerous in a wonderful way

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:50.300
because it turns out

00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:52.573
the original work being worked on,

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.740
is not a finished text
when it enters the rehearsal hall.

00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:57.556
It needs to be
opened up again.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.505
Remember,

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:03.087
the moment you give that,
an original work or new work,

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:06.382
to a group of collaborators,
directors, actors,

00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:08.000
designers,
what-have-yous,

00:10:08.947 --> 00:10:11.922
it’s practically open
to multiple readings.

00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:14.583
The designer
visualizes her reading.

00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:17.198
The director makes an act
from her reading.

00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:20.325
The actor adds layer as well.

00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:24.193
And I think, presuming
that the playwright

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:27.444
seizes the opportunity
to collaborate

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.750
and is open to collaborate
to begin with,

00:10:30.902 --> 00:10:34.549
I think it’s a wonderful start
of a creative process.

00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:38.460
After the text, I remember working
with Maynard and Dingdong,

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:40.355
on "Kafatiran"
and "Symposium".

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:43.292
When the text is there,
when the playwright is there,

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:48.087
my immediate task is to determine
the kind of suspension of disbelief needed.

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:49.992
Will we take responsibility
of the world?

00:10:50.043 --> 00:10:53.668
The text will develop from there.
Subtexts will spring up.

00:10:53.713 --> 00:10:56.611
Sometimes, the director
or actors carry it out.

00:10:56.675 --> 00:10:58.478
It's always for consultation.

00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:04.094
If we're given four
gay Katipuneros,

00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:06.478
