00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.115
Okay, congratulations.

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:20.859
You’ve done your first draft.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.779
But of course,
every “congratulations”

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.302
goes with “looking forward.”

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.533
We call it the first draft

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:31.099
because it’s only natural

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:34.580
and normal to have your second,

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:38.774
third, until your final draft.

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:46.549
There are playwrights who think

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:49.446
they're writing a novel,
and once they get published,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.482
that's it.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.503
As if it were already
set in stone.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.898
Or it's like a poem,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.573
since it’s very personal,

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:03.106
you can’t change anything,
not even a punctuation mark.

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.776
That’s how some
of them see a play.

00:01:05.847 --> 00:01:09.229
They want to show that
“I’ve thought about this very carefully.”

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:15.690
“Every word and every breath,
so how dare you change it."

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:19.992
I respect those
kinds of playwrights

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:25.934
but I don’t share
the same sentiments.

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:32.538
Firstly and personally,
as a playwright,

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:39.685
one foot is in theater
while the other is in literature.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:45.045
While you could have
that kind of attitude in literature

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:52.588
but in theater,
you open yourself

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:57.739
through your work
to collaborators,

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:03.511
since they’re the ones
who’ll bring your story to life.

00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:06.174
You won't be the one
performing to the audience.

00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:08.761
They can only
hear what you wrote.

00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:11.476
They will only see the actors,

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.716
and how they deliver it

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:19.245
has an effect
on how you wrote it.

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:24.865
There are times when

00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:28.085
actors would say,

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:33.133
“I can’t figure this out,
is it alright to do this instead?"

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:36.200
For me, that’s part

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:39.779
of the writing process
of a playwright.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:44.382
It means that once
you’ve done your first draft,

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.874
it needs to be rehearsed.

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:49.274
It needs to be produced.

00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:55.856
The journey from the first draft
until the production draft,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.910
is an arduous one.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.504
And revising
is naturally also a part of it.

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:09.430
I’m not saying you have to do
everything the director says,

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.571
especially if they’re well-known.

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:14.170
I'm also not saying

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.394
you need to accept
everything right away,

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.671
like when an actor tells you
she can’t pronounce a word,

00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:24.976
you have to weigh the importance
of the words you wrote,

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:27.563
especially if it’s to the point
where you can’t just change the lines

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.950
to accommodate your actors.

00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:33.521
That's not all.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:38.878
During the first reading,
it needs to be read publicly.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.558
When I say publicly,
by the production team.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:48.062
This is where you’ll first hear
your work read aloud by others,

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:52.922
which means they
can interpret it differently.

00:03:54.029 --> 00:04:00.180
This may give you new ideas
on how you’ll change the lines.

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:06.844
Aside from that,
when you hear it read by others,

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:14.368
you’ll realize then
if it works or not.

00:04:14.744 --> 00:04:22.633
Because if it doesn't work,
no matter how serious, earnest,

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:28.580
and dedicated you were in planning it,
it may still be lacking something.

00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:32.166
And you should be open to that.

00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:36.848
Ideally, this is where
the director helps you.

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:39.865
I know there are different
kinds of directors,

00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:42.262
some could be
terrifying and so on.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.479
But in an ideal world,
the director’s purpose

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:54.402
is to show you how
your story can come to life

00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:57.699
and how to enhance it.

00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:05.004
This is where
the element of trust comes in

00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:09.668
in terms of choosing
people to work with.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.709
I cannot emphasize
enough the importance

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:21.678
of revisions during rehearsals,
readings, and even 'til production.

00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:26.229
Even if there’s no rehearsal

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:30.063
or if you’re just about to rehearse,

00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:33.673
It’s important for you
to hear people read it aloud

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:38.009
and it’s also good
to hear their opinions about it.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:41.672
I’m not saying you have
to accept all their opinions.

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:43.170
Filter it.

00:05:44.312 --> 00:05:46.773
Why is it important?

00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:50.092
Because the play you wrote

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:56.525
wasn't written to be read,
but to be heard.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.311
And to be heard in theater means
an audience watches it collectively.

00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:10.013
They’re sitting side by side.
And they react collectively as well.

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:16.717
The response
in theater is immediate,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.479
especially during its release.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.058
That’s how you’ll measure
how successful your show is.

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:33.320
I’m not talking
about the ticket sales,

00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:36.492
I’m talking about
the reaction of the audience.

00:06:37.894 --> 00:06:39.431
Listen to it

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:42.222
and compare it
to your objectives.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.526
Then compare it

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:50.568
to your honest-to-goodness
view of your own play.

00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:54.893
When you tally that,

00:06:54.952 --> 00:07:00.678
you’ll see if you
should revise it or not.

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:05.144
But more often than not,
in my experience,

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.121
I still revise it—

00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:12.264
not because I blindly follow them.

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:19.519
There are just instances
during production that I disagree with.

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:22.764
And anyway, what I wrote
still comes back to me.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.176
Once the show's over,
it's also over for production.

00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:31.051
While the play I wrote
is still with me.

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.887
And there’s a possibility
that it could be staged again

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.691
or be published
using my own version.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.578
So that’s the life of a play.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.760
Like what Joseph Conrad said,

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:52.456
“A work is never finished,
it is only abandoned.”

00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:57.651
I want to view the writing process
of any form in that way,

00:07:57.772 --> 00:08:03.312
but especially in writing a play.

00:08:03.653 --> 00:08:06.128
It’s never done for me.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:10.098
I’m only abandoning it
because I’m writing another play.

00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:20.254
From the point of view of revising,
there are two important things:

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:27.057
to hear someone
read it aloud 'til it’s shown

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:30.868
and to listen to yourself.

00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:33.317
Be honest to yourself

00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:40.167
so you can weigh on how
you’ll change your work.

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:46.558
Nevertheless, if you’ve done
your first draft, I salute you.
