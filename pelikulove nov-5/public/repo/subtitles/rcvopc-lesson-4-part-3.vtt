00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:14.842
Next.

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.500
Masikat or Masi lives in Recto, Avenida.

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:22.218
In the cluster of houses
in front of the provincial bus station

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:23.915
at the back of Manila City Jail.

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:28.340
In a community that
depends on pedicab driving,

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.279
if not stealing things
or selling drugs.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:34.831
Most of the women
have stalls around Divisoria

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:39.011
if not doing the classic livelihood
of doing laundry.

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:41.308
Masi is 16 years old

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.637
and his dream is to leave
the housefly-infested town.

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.841
His tidy appearance is a stark contrast
the griminess of Recto,

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.379
unblemished with no scars or scratches.

00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:56.754
If he was left in the affluent part of town,
and was dressed up a bit,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.832
he could pass off as a resident
of that neighborhood.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:03.287
He’s not that smart,
but his dream is big enough.

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:07.348
Intelligence shouldn’t be measured
in the way one speaks

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:13.461
or in one’s broken English,
but in the way one can explain things

00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.576
which could be learnt
at school or outside.

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:21.569
But the things that Masi lacks
is what makes him interesting.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.933
He has a good grasp on education

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:26.523
and strongly believes
it’ll give him a better life.

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:30.158
He usually hangs out at Dan’s place,
also known as Daddy.

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:33.113
Dan is one of those people
who are well-off.

00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:39.390
Masi often stays at other places,
especially since he lives in a cramped house.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.578
Masi only knows that Dan’s a model.

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.982
Dan leaves at night
with an extremely powdered face

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.209
and comes back still smelling good
in the morning.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:50.670
Masi takes care of Dan’s house.

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:56.635
From cleaning his shoes
to folding his shiny underwear.

00:01:56.736 --> 00:02:00.479
Masi could almost be Dan's partner,

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.263
although he calls him Daddy.

00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:07.767
In fact, they’re already like a couple
since they sleep together.

00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:11.541
In exchange, Dan pays for his tuition.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.851
But Masi doesn’t feel like a prostitute

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:16.209
especially since he respects
and loves Dan so much.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:20.153
Until one day, Masi came down
with an intense fever.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.641
His mother even had to bring him
to the hospital,

00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:25.446
and that’s where he found out
that he was sick.

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:27.521
He was HIV positive.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:29.474
That’s the description.

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:31.327
For the monologue,

00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:32.936
I set it at dusk

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.686
inside a broken pedicab
at the sidewalk.

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:38.880
Masi's face to face
with his bestfriend, Lily.

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:42.551
Holding the paper
that San Lazaro Hospital gave him.

00:02:42.748 --> 00:02:45.615
Lily is crying nonstop
while Masi is talking.

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:47.510
Masi.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:50.749
Masi: “You keep on crying, honey.
It’s so annoying.”

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:51.751
“Stop it, already.”

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:52.484
“Why?”

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:53.625
He slaps her cheek.

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.467
"I'm still okay."

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:57.248
“You’re too judgmental.”

00:02:57.327 --> 00:03:00.578
“The doctor said
that the Human-Inum—"

00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:02.408
"Fuck, just read it. It’s all there.”

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.098
“I just have to take some meds.”

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.471
“I won’t die.”

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.102
“He said it’s just like diabetes.”

00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:11.079
“In fact, my mother’s worries faded.”

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.793
“Because even grandma
has diabetes and she’s still alive.”

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.214
“My god, honey!
Think of how many meds I’ll take!”

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:19.309
“Aren’t the rich like that?”

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.614
“But dear, the meds have a side effect.”

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.249
“It’s like you’re dreaming
or you’re seeing things.”

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:29.806
“Maybe Recto might look better
and less ugly with this.”

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.640
“Maybe this Human inum-inum
could disappear.”

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.412
“Maybe I could still go to Daddy.”

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:40.200
“That’s all I see when there’s—
Fuck! It’s so hard to pronounce.”

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.653
There are cracks in his voice.

00:03:41.928 --> 00:03:43.522
Lily: “Stop crying, dear.”

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.798
“I’ll still do your makeup.”

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.087
“We’ll still go to school together.”

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:48.748
”We’ll still be on fleek together.”

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.327
Masi: “I won’t die yet, right?”

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.149
“Come on! Give me the paper, hon.”

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:01.938
It’s like a short story.

00:04:02.127 --> 00:04:06.867
[indistinct chatter]

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:11.701
What do you think?

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.918
- With how the character was described,
you really understand who he is.

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:23.402
In Maynard’s description of Masi,

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:26.820
you already know
this is going to be his language

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:30.018
because if he strays away from this,
you already know.

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:35.327
- The character is very clear

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:42.918
and the way Maynard
wrote the monologue of the character

00:04:42.975 --> 00:04:50.258
is so out and you know,
suits the description.

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:54.985
This is one of the examples
of you giving situations

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.661
to see how the character will react

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.999
and you didn’t give him
a typical reaction like

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.514
“Hon! It’s just the two of us left,
we can do this.”

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:04.718
He's not like that.

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.454
In that scene,
you showed his characterization

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:11.968
without the typical,

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:15.235
“You know me, I’m happy with life.”

00:05:15.327 --> 00:05:19.846
He really acted his characterization

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:25.656
without feeding or indicating so much,
which was nice.

00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:29.796
Is he promiscuous or faithful to Daddy?

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:33.665
- What I’m thinking of right now
is more of that, the promiscuous one is--

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:36.163
So it means Daddy also has HIV?

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:38.696
- Looks like that’s the channel.

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.376
- He’s (Masi) the faithful one.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.274
So, it’s not a loose,
loose life, right?

00:05:46.572 --> 00:05:48.130
He just got it from one.

00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:53.212
It didn’t figure in his equation.

00:05:53.757 --> 00:05:56.707
He knows there’s free medicine
and these other things,

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.840
he seems to have been informed,

00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:06.141
but the hospital also informs
you during counseling,

00:06:06.203 --> 00:06:08.146
“How many partners have you had?”

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.263
That’s like the first question.

00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:13.486
“Why am I asking?”

00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.187
"Because one of them
might have infected you. "

00:06:16.314 --> 00:06:18.359
"But I only have sex
with one person."

00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:28.912
You could almost sense
that he would have to confront Daddy

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.141
about this if he wants

00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:35.994
because right now,
what we can see

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.413
is his positive attitude.

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.822
By doing so, what does
he want now?

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:49.065
Apparently, he reacted to this illness

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:54.868
in a very, in fact,
his reaction is not normal.

00:06:55.077 --> 00:06:58.250
Going crazy is more normal.

00:06:58.305 --> 00:07:01.241
But he seems
to be very composed

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.706
and seems to be very
level-headed about his condition.

00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:10.151
And so, because of that,

00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:12.671
whether you’re thinking
if he’s in denial or not,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.926
that level-headedness
is also what’s going to save him.

00:07:17.298 --> 00:07:22.072
Right now, I think, that issue
has been resolved.

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:23.553
Oh game.

00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:26.762
Erps. This isn't me, okay.

00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:27.851
43 years old.

00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:31.855
Erps is a name he got
since he was in highschool.

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:35.230
Back in the 80s,
as a corruption of brother: pre.

00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:38.388
After graduating college,
he has been in the corporate world.

00:07:38.568 --> 00:07:41.809
In one of his mid-life crisis moments,
he wanted to try other things,

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:43.483
particularly, writing.

00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:46.185
He attended workshops,
dabbled into writing a little bit

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:48.411
And immersed himself
with a younger crowd.

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:50.009
He went to bars
and gay clubs

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:54.447
and that’s where he met Ardy,
who was 22 at that time.

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:57.179
There was an immediate
connection between the two.

00:07:57.238 --> 00:08:00.471
And at the age of 40, single,
and not really attractive,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.108
he found it interesting
to have someone like Ardy

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:04.623
be interested in him.

00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:07.240
Erps and Ardy
had a rocky relationship

00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:09.066
Most of the time with Ardy
calling it quits,

00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:11.534
but Erps was very,
very patient and tolerant

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.591
to the point of being
taken advantage of.

00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:16.202
For the two-year relationship
between Erps and Ardy

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:19.016
they’ve done many things,
shared many experiences,

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:21.251
And they considered each other
soulmates.

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:23.815
Even giving Erps
his first produced play.

00:08:23.893 --> 00:08:24.620
This isn’t me.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:29.243
And for two years they were together,
It was always Erps and Ardy.

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:32.193
Living together,
doing everything together

00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.843
that aside from work and Ardy,

00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:36.831
Erps didn’t have time
or interest in anything else

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:39.694
A few months later,
Ardy has died of dengue

00:08:39.772 --> 00:08:41.839
And at one point,
Erps is blaming himself

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.748
for not taking care
of his soulmate.

00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:44.931
Since Ardy’s death,

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:47.272
Erps has kept himself
busy with work.

00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:49.931
Not really putting
himself out there.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.369
Three months later,
Erps has met someone from work.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:53.696
he is interested in.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.000
Someone who
reminds him of Ardy.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:56.608
Now he is beginning
to doubt himself.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.875
This concept of soulmates.

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:02.520
If he has grieved enough
and it’s time to move on.

00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:05.358
Or if it is too soon after using Ardy

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:10.249
that it’s a betrayal to even consider
someone else to be in a relationship with.

00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:12.448
After all, they vowed to be soulmates.

00:09:12.516 --> 00:09:14.382
That’s the character sketch.

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:16.960
Monologue?

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:22.715
This monologue is when
he’s talking to his friend on the phone.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.058
Erps: “Hello, Babs?”

00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:27.704
“Si Erps to, Euripides.
Yes, I know, long time.”

00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:30.072
“Yup, still there.
San Miguel since birth.”

00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:31.567
“Are you going out tomorrow?”

00:09:31.723 --> 00:09:33.491
“Favor, can you come over
to my place?”

00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:36.382
“My condo here in BGC
near Stopover.”

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:39.904
“I can meet you at Starbs
And go to my unit together.”

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.733
“Starbs, Starbucks.”

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:44.762
“And one more thing,
Can you bring your tarot cards?”

00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:46.367
“Aren’t you into that sort of thing?"

00:09:46.407 --> 00:09:50.221
“You know the weird, I mean,
occult, new age sort of stuff.”

00:09:50.287 --> 00:09:51.763
“I want to get my fortune told."

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.799
“Do I need to prepare anything?”

00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:55.322
“Like candles,
or I don’t know, tablecloth?”

00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:57.765
“That’s red, velvet, red? Red velvet?”

00:09:57.808 --> 00:09:59.950
“Oh, okay. For snacks.”

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:01.211
“Coffee, of course.”

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:02.230
“Alright, let’s set it.”

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.279
“3pm at Starbs."

00:10:03.357 --> 00:10:03.956
“Starbs.”

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:04.907
“Are you g?”

00:10:04.973 --> 00:10:06.869
“Nevermind, you’re pretty old.”

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:08.054
“Fine, I mean we.”

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.048
“Tomorrow ha.”

00:10:09.114 --> 00:10:09.556
“G.”

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:14.295
The dengue seems corny for me.

00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:16.466
- That comes with the...

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.199
guilt.

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:22.293
What does?

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:26.097
It’s like, who dies of dengue…

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:34.938
It seems shallow,

00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:38.369
it’s so easy to solve it
in this day and age

00:10:38.477 --> 00:10:41.872
But he kind of still missed out.

00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.068
This might backfire. It's like--

00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:55.804
Like, oh no he died of dengue,
he’s so old.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.641
Usually, in terms of impression,
there’s more heartbreak

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.067
for a 10-year-old child
to die of dengue.

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:10.048
That gets in the way,
what the disease is.

00:11:10.994 --> 00:11:15.220
In “Die Beautiful,”
we thought of not using AIDS

00:11:15.377 --> 00:11:21.275
because it will open up a lot of,
so many different, other problems.

00:11:21.873 --> 00:11:24.220
Then, let’s just make it...

00:11:24.294 --> 00:11:25.568
what's it again?

00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:27.469
Aneurysm.

00:11:28.724 --> 00:11:29.857
Instant.

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:30.768
Gone.

00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:31.567
Finished.

00:11:32.463 --> 00:11:33.458
That's already solved.

00:11:34.825 --> 00:11:37.244
No questions asked.

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.251
When you choose the illness,

00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:48.559
choose one that won’t open
distracting questions to the audience.

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:51.962
Unless you want it in a comic way
like you’re saying,

00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:56.463
“Oh my God, he died
because of dengue?”

00:11:56.541 --> 00:12:00.102
“But there’s no mosquito
in the house!”

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.774
Unless you want
to play it up like that.

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:06.367
You can also embrace that, okay?

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.985
- This is Father Victor.

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:11.458
So we’re with Maui?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.378
[inaudible]

00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:14.592
- Who went jogging?
- The one who went jogging.

00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:15.637
Is this a convent?
- Yeah.

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.108
Where is this?
Do you have a setting?

00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:19.636
Yes

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:20.166
Where?

00:12:20.192 --> 00:12:21.992
At the town of St. Nicolas.

00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:24.280
Rural?
The area’s rural.

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:31.451
Father Victor, 30 years old.
Assistant parish priest in the town.

00:12:31.512 --> 00:12:36.922
He just got back to the town
after staying in Manila for ten years.

00:12:37.098 --> 00:12:41.900
The mayor’s wife is his old flame.

00:12:42.349 --> 00:12:47.352
While studying philosophy in Manila,
he heard that his girlfriend got married

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.335
to his childhood friend, the mayor,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.748
who's also the son of his parents’
employers before.

00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:58.991
At the age of seven, his mother
left him for some man.

00:12:59.109 --> 00:13:04.664
At the age of ten, he saw his father
burn alive in an old basement.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:07.137
He was adopted
by the town’s parish priest

00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:09.556
who sent him to study philosophy
in order to become a teacher.

00:13:09.615 --> 00:13:12.419
Because of his ex-girlfriend’s marriage
to his childhood friend,

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:15.977
the parish priest forced him
to become a priest

00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:19.906
in order to escape
that painful event in his life.

00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:22.345
Fr. Victor grew up
having an inquisitive mind.

00:13:22.404 --> 00:13:25.057
He’s usually withdrawn
at the seminary.

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:30.194
But he’s gotten into a lot of fights
Because of his short temper.

00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:32.536
He’s playful to people close to him

00:13:32.575 --> 00:13:39.234
but at unexpected moments,
you’ll see him quiet, but full of rage.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.660
Monologue.

00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:47.131
Fr. Victor: “Why did I agree to come back
to this cursed village”

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.704
“when I’ve been living
a quiet life in Manila?”

00:13:50.252 --> 00:13:53.012
“To relive the wounds of the past?”
“No.”

00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:58.158
“To stress my being a failure?”
“Yes, I’m a failure.”

00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:00.692
“What do you mean no?
Why don’t you answer this question?”

00:14:00.771 --> 00:14:03.836
“Why did my mother abandon me
When I was a child?”

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.338
“First, because she hates me."

00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:10.701
“She hates poverty.”
“I was a sickly child.”

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:15.349
“Instead of taking care of me,
she left with some man.”

00:14:15.642 --> 00:14:19.935
“No. My father had nothing to do
with mother’s decision to leave.”

00:14:19.994 --> 00:14:21.517
“Father was a good person.”

00:14:21.576 --> 00:14:24.238
“He’d do anything for us
to have a good life.”

00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:25.820
“Yes, he was an alcoholic.”

00:14:26.856 --> 00:14:30.111
“If you were my father,
you’d probably be an alcoholic ”

00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:31.731
“just to escape poverty."

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.999
“Even so, my father never left me."

00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:41.787
“If only he didn’t burn
with the basement of fertilizers,”

00:14:41.812 --> 00:14:43.130
“he’d still be alive.”

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:45.755
“No. What happened
wasn’t an accident.”

00:14:45.814 --> 00:14:47.236
“Someone killed him.”

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:49.639
“I saw it with my own eyes
while the basement was on fire.”

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.866
“It was locked from the outside.”

00:14:51.964 --> 00:14:54.964
“Do you think cats
could lock a basement?”

00:14:55.038 --> 00:14:56.288
“You’re right. It can’t”

00:14:56.659 --> 00:15:00.956
“I’m sure of it.
My father was murdered.”

00:15:01.037 --> 00:15:04.084
“Now, tell me I’m not a failure."

00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:05.407
“Who?”

00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:06.617
“That was a long time ago.”

00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:09.197
“And she’s happy
with the life she chose.”

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:12.148
“She should be happy!
If not, then that’s karma.”

00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:14.648
“I believe in karma.”

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:18.722
“Whatever you do to others,
will come back to you.”

00:15:18.805 --> 00:15:20.399
“Sometimes, much more to you.”

00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:23.075
“What do I care
if her husband hits her?”

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:26.120
“That’s just right so she can
at least feel the pain I felt”

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.910
“when she left me for another man.”

00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:31.058
“She’s just like my mother.”

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:33.617
“Never content with what she has.”

00:15:33.642 --> 00:15:36.747
“Not caring even if she hurts people.”

00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:39.897
“Go ahead! She’s not the one in pain.”

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:41.592
“Karma is real.”

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.341
“And it’ll come at her doorstep.”

00:15:43.531 --> 00:15:46.606
“Like an incurable disease.”

00:15:46.854 --> 00:15:49.509
“And if it doesn’t come to her?”

00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:50.776
“I tell you.”

00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:57.435
“I’ll be karma itself
until she regrets the day she left me.”

00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:01.552
“I’m a failure, but they’ll see
I won’t be alone.”

00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:08.817
“Like what they did to me,
I’ll crush them into the failures they are.

00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:11.940
Right now, he doesn’t sound like a priest.

00:16:13.582 --> 00:16:17.095
He seems like a priest in label only.

00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:22.291
- Sorry, why did he become a priest?

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:26.844
- He became a priest to escape
what was done to him.

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.182
- By the two girls?

00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:29.385
- The one girl.

00:16:29.424 --> 00:16:30.549
[inaudible]

00:16:30.612 --> 00:16:32.512
The one who married the mayor.

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:39.064
- His anger when his girlfriend left him

00:16:39.143 --> 00:16:42.990
is a step back
to when his mother left him.

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:49.397
- First, his mother left him.
Next, the woman he loved left him.

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:53.513
- When I wrote this,

00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:57.591
it was a misbelief over something.

00:16:57.763 --> 00:16:59.976
- Of some facts
that he didn’t know about.

00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:04.635
- You asked a while ago,
how come he’s very angry here?

00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:06.127
- What does he know?

00:17:06.572 --> 00:17:09.062
- Just because she got married
he’s already so angry?

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:16.127
Victor’s objective
is apparently revenge.

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:19.321
When was that objective formed?

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:23.578
When he became a priest
or when he was already in town?

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:25.492
- When he got back to town.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:34.209
- The dialogue I thought of for this
was he didn’t see any change in the town.

00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:36.800
- When he left, it was still like that.

00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:40.070
- Even after ten years,
he’s still seeing the same things.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:42.456
Even the corruption.

00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:48.511
Even after priesthood?
How many years was that?

00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:51.563
About seven, I would say.

00:17:51.902 --> 00:17:57.901
- He was fourth year in philosophy
when his ex got married.

00:17:58.229 --> 00:18:02.166
- He studied priesthood for four years.

00:18:02.223 --> 00:18:07.494
Four. Three years outside.
How about other parishes?

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:11.181
- Seven?
- It took 10 years for him to go back home.

00:18:11.728 --> 00:18:14.967
Ten years. So how old was he then?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.694
- Thirty.

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.291
Thirty. And the girl?

00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:18.792
- About the same.

00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:29.760
In those ten years, with how he talks,
I imagine he’s so angry,

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.008
In those ten years,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.179
it's as if nothing affected
the way he talks.

00:18:37.314 --> 00:18:44.911
Because of his words and his anger,
of his all-consuming hate,

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:52.796
I kind of hear the Victor
who hasn’t undergone priesthood yet.

00:18:53.177 --> 00:19:02.765
I didn’t see the angry Victor
who became a priest.

00:19:04.074 --> 00:19:16.034
That means he didn’t imbibe
the patience, virtues, philosophy he studied.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:20.940
I imagined him like a friar.

00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:24.807
He’s not the kind of priest
that we’re familiar with.

00:19:24.893 --> 00:19:29.377
He’s like Padre Damaso
who’s holding something in,

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:32.210
but pleasant to everyone else.

00:19:32.264 --> 00:19:36.404
But even then,
the likes of Padre Damaso,

00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:47.267
the profanity that he spouts
is mixed with the religiosity he preaches.

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:53.357
In fact, “In Jesus’ Name” is his litany.

00:19:53.437 --> 00:20:01.752
But here, there’s nothing like that,
which is what confuses me.

00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:09.913
- I still don’t know
how I’m going to weave it

00:20:09.972 --> 00:20:12.468
taking into consideration
what Rody said

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.028
that this is already
the devil talking

00:20:15.087 --> 00:20:18.230
even Padre Damaso
would have some goodness inside.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:22.628
No, it’s not the goodness
that I’m questioning.

00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:28.072
It’s the language that he uses.

00:20:32.354 --> 00:20:37.167
Even Maui is different.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.273
Why would a church

00:20:40.366 --> 00:20:53.832
in a farflung place allow
a flamboyant gay to live with them?

00:20:54.024 --> 00:20:59.311
They would, of course,
ask for propriety.

00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:02.658
If you want to do this,
do it but in a soft voice.

00:21:02.686 --> 00:21:05.218
Those kinds of strictures.

00:21:06.362 --> 00:21:08.557
In Victor’s monologue,

00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:12.646
I don’t feel the establishment
of the church

00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:15.616
because he’s not using
the language of the church.

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:19.153
What he’s using
is the language of a peasant

00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:21.988
who is consumed with hate

00:21:24.754 --> 00:21:30.772
but Victor has already undergone
a training of priesthood

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.894
and part of that training is…

00:21:35.066 --> 00:21:41.019
for example, if you have an M.A.
and you’re angry,

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:44.459
you talk differently.

00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:49.640
You use and rationalize
what you have learned

00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:56.128
so that you can deepen
the premise of your anger.

00:21:57.854 --> 00:22:03.244
I'm not saying turn Victor
into a soft-hearted person.

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:04.890
It could be there

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:12.127
but he’s using
what he has learned in priesthood,

00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:16.025
what he has learned
in the establishment of the church

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:19.853
so that he can also rationalize it.

00:22:20.887 --> 00:22:24.195
Like what you’re saying,
this is not revenge.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.554
This is justice.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:36.448
See, even that is already a perversion
of the tenets of the Catholic Church.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.323
That’s what I’m looking for.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.886
So that I can understand it better
and to convince myself

00:22:45.026 --> 00:22:48.384
that yes, he’s angry,
but he’s still a priest.

00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:51.956
In the same way
that we understand Padre Salvi.

00:22:53.044 --> 00:23:01.787
He’s quiet but the way he engineered
the death of Maria Clara and Crisostomo Ibarra

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:06.235
using precisely the words of God.

00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:10.286
That looks more evil.

00:23:13.332 --> 00:23:21.595
Maybe that’s what would create
and shape your character uniquely.

00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:26.856
Because we’re talking
about a man of God

00:23:27.442 --> 00:23:30.413
and what we know of priests

00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:35.404
is that they’re always quiet and calm,

00:23:35.544 --> 00:23:36.999
But this is the opposite.

00:23:38.638 --> 00:23:41.872
But if you do it in reverse,
it may disappear.

00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:44.588
He still has to be

00:23:45.844 --> 00:23:47.281
a man of God.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.252
But he distorted it.

00:23:52.198 --> 00:23:54.298
But we’re like that, right?

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.370
Even if we’re corrupt,
we rationalize it

00:23:58.092 --> 00:23:59.995
because my child is like this,

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:03.062
rather than him dying,
I’ll just accept what the mayor gave.

00:24:03.114 --> 00:24:04.708
Something like that, right?

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:08.184
But that’s in the milieu that you have.

00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:11.452
In the same way, if that’s a priest,

00:24:11.526 --> 00:24:16.221
I’m sure they’re rationalizing it
in religious terms.

00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:19.064
- "I’m doing this because..."
- "Because of this."

00:24:19.147 --> 00:24:21.087
"As Jesus said,"

00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:22.938
You even quoted the Bible.

00:24:24.056 --> 00:24:27.670
"When the four horsemen
of the apocalypse arrive."

00:24:28.398 --> 00:24:29.170
I don’t know.

00:24:29.915 --> 00:24:34.397
Justice is waiting and so on.

00:24:35.643 --> 00:24:39.956
Maybe that’s where
the religious aspect comes in

00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:43.652
because the traces
of the establishment would disappear.

00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:47.336
- Do you have more suggestions?

00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:51.975
- In terms of the character’s objective
that should be important to the protagonist?

00:24:52.047 --> 00:24:57.194
Usually the character’s objective
is conceptual in the mind of the writer.

00:24:57.255 --> 00:25:00.542
For example, she’s looking
for happiness or something

00:25:00.676 --> 00:25:06.723
or sometimes it works
if the objective is physical

00:25:06.816 --> 00:25:10.910
like she needs to pass the bar exams
or to go to Batanes.

00:25:11.846 --> 00:25:13.374
How do you balance it?

00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:18.230
Or do you have suggestions
on how to articulate the objectives

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.423
whether it’s for conceptual
or physical?

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.173
It has to be very concrete and specific.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.227
It cannot be “I want love.”

00:25:28.531 --> 00:25:30.235
"I want to feel love. "

00:25:30.552 --> 00:25:32.574
That doesn’t mean anything.

00:25:33.374 --> 00:25:35.359
It has to be very specific.

00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:36.668
"I want.."

00:25:38.936 --> 00:25:41.454
"my mother to come here and embrace me "

00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:47.119
"...because she has been away
for so long and she has ignored me. "

00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:49.845
It can be that specific.

00:25:51.762 --> 00:25:55.556
But it still has to be an all-consuming desire.

00:25:55.836 --> 00:25:57.385
Desire for revenge,

00:25:57.764 --> 00:26:01.369
desire for closure.

00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:07.534
The writer needs to be conscious
so it need not be articulated.

00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:10.054
That is the reason why you’re dramatizing it.

00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:14.784
You don’t need to say
at a certain point that he’s going to say that.

00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:15.627
No.

00:26:16.398 --> 00:26:20.961
He could hide or, in fact, deny it

00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:25.059
because he was rationalizing.

00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:26.817
For example, even revenge,

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.610
he could also deny it,
“I’m not out for revenge."

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:32.594
"I’m just out for justice”

00:26:32.664 --> 00:26:34.750
Which in fact can be the same thing.

00:26:38.043 --> 00:26:41.337
So there are many ways to execute it.

00:26:41.904 --> 00:26:43.214
And the best way

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:46.682
is when you say something

00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:48.651
without explicitly saying it.

00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:51.296
The audience is the one who says it.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.280
“Ah, he wants love.”

00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:58.161
When she says that,
without you saying it at all in your play,

00:26:58.266 --> 00:26:59.772
even the very word,

00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:03.508
then you achieved it.

00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:07.682
But to be more concrete in terms of objective,

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.709
that’s the most important.

00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:14.858
Tomorrow, we’ll find out
how to make this more vivid.

00:27:15.236 --> 00:27:19.064
Because you can’t really show
what the character wants

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.603
if there is no

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:22.798
obstacle.

00:27:23.084 --> 00:27:25.354
Because if you don’t put an obstacle,

00:27:26.475 --> 00:27:27.815
then she easily achieves it.

00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:32.657
She easily achieves it.

00:27:32.764 --> 00:27:37.396
Now, if you put an obstacle,
what he wants becomes clearer.

00:27:37.715 --> 00:27:40.073
And the question, “Is he going to get it or not?”

00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:42.793
becomes clearer to the audience

00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:46.017
which is why it’s integral—

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.796
the relationship of the character and the conflict.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.951
Right now, some of your characters

00:27:53.012 --> 00:27:56.206
have not articulated what they really want.

00:27:57.195 --> 00:27:59.273
And that’s why I’m asking you, writers,

00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:01.185
whether you know or not.

00:28:01.272 --> 00:28:04.231
Because if the character doesn’t know,
it’s probably alright.

00:28:04.265 --> 00:28:06.538
But if the writer doesn’t know,
then you have a problem.

00:28:06.588 --> 00:28:10.423
I’m not saying you
should have an answer right now.

00:28:10.478 --> 00:28:13.676
In fact, maybe in the course
of writing the play, you may realize,

00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:15.342
“Damn, this is not it.”

00:28:17.243 --> 00:28:18.117
Something like that.

00:28:20.122 --> 00:28:22.618
Even I want something different for him.

00:28:22.682 --> 00:28:24.036
That’s also possible, right?

00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:25.514
It’s not working.

00:28:25.562 --> 00:28:27.566
What he wants is actually very simple.

00:28:27.648 --> 00:28:29.831
It’s so easy to get.

00:28:29.939 --> 00:28:32.494
So whatever obstacle you put,
he’ll get it, right?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.870
That’s what’s slightly hard.

00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:39.624
Clarifying what one really wants.
