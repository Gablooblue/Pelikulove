00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.771
If you look at your examples
which I assume you wrote,

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.702
There are only two ways
to tell a story in dramatic writing.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:35.018
By describing an action
and by using dialogue.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:45.490
Keep in mind that people
are going to watch what you've written.

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:54.519
And it will only come to life
once actors perform it on stage.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:58.740
That's the only way
to tell the story.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:09.851
Whatever description you write
won't necessarily be seen.

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:21.078
Writing a script is specifically
to provide instruction

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:30.063
to the director, actor,
and production crew.

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:34.772
That's the reason
why scripts are written that way.

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:40.913
You have to indicate
who is speaking and what she'll say.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:47.455
You also have to include
what the character will do.

00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:49.396
Will she drink?

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.477
Will she sit?
Will she cry at this point?

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.069
Will she scream?

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.581
Will she commit murder?
Are they going to fight?

00:01:56.658 --> 00:02:04.147
These are all written
in the script you're writing.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.226
And...

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:14.014
this includes what
and how she's saying it,

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.857
and the words she's using.

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.259
Okay, let's try it.
Who wants to start?

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.383
Hector: "Cut!"

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.273
"Didn't I tell you to slap first
and then look at the camera?"

00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:28.527
Diane: "I'm trying a new style."

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.184
Hector: "This isn't the time to do that."

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:35.834
Diane: "I'm sure we have time,
we have all the time in the world."

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.835
Hector: "We're out of time.
I've run out of patience."

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:40.998
Diane: "I've been very patient with you."

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:44.675
"I've waited so long. Surely, what's a few
more minutes to try this out?"

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.605
Hector: "No. You know what?
I can't work with you anymore."

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.416
Diane: "Let's be professional."

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:53.681
"What? You can't function anymore
just because I called it quits?"

00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:58.478
"You used to give me freedom.
We used to explore all these things together."

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.077
Hector: "Consider that a privilege
that you no longer have."

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:06.199
"You enjoyed that for seven years.
And just because we can't take it one step further...?"

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:09.317
"No, that's done. I'm done.
You're nothing to me."

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:12.128
Diane slaps him
and looks at the camera.

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:14.965
So he didn’t explain.

00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:18.500
From what we’ve heard,

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:23.633
let's determine...

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:28.766
the who, what, where,
and why to find out.

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.621
And if there’s a how.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.472
Let’s start with the "who."

00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:39.957
Who did we see
or hear in the scene?

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:43.537
They have names.
Hector and Diane.

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:44.645
And then?

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:46.107
What are they?

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:48.789
- Diane is an actress.

00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:51.219
- Diane is an actress.
- And Hector?

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.777
Director.

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:55.597
Where are they?

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:58.154
They're in a shoot.

00:03:58.277 --> 00:04:02.449
But we don’t know the setting
of the shoot yet.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:04.065
What's happening?

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:08.265
- The director's telling her
she couldn’t get the scene right.

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.471
- But she takes it personally.

00:04:12.926 --> 00:04:15.375
- Or she made it personal.

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:16.967
Who's taking it personally?

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:18.517
Diane.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.389
She's taking the comments personally.

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:29.381
- Seems like their working relationship's
been constrained for sometime.

00:04:30.777 --> 00:04:33.683
Did we get it right?

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:35.562
Based on the...

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:36.602
- Yeah, deeper.

00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:40.466
Or are you just agreeing...?

00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:42.727
- Just to say something.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:46.199
Is there anything else?

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:47.800
Nothing?

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.735
So the whole set-up is a film shoot.

00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.802
Who's next?

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.082
Okay, Carlo.

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:05.971
- In a dark, hazy,
claustrophobic room

00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:07.984
Karlo is in an Indian sitting position.

00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:08.877
- He's doing what?

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.840
Karlo's in an Indian sitting position
facing the window.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.541
There's a silhouette
because of the bright sunlight.

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:20.685
He has a smoke on one hand
and beer on the other.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:22.768
Karlo.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.113
"Six years."

00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:28.569
"It's been that long."

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:31.043
"Expired, in other words."

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.977
"But it's as if everything's still fresh
whenever I think of you."

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:39.020
"I miss you."

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:44.880
"I need some peace of mind but...

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:47.065
...you're so far away."

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:49.455
"I'm here in Manila
while you're there in Batanes."

00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:52.346
"But, no."

00:05:52.564 --> 00:05:53.252
"I'll stop."

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.621
"I'll stop this."

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.524
"I'll go to you
so I can stop this."

00:05:57.745 --> 00:05:59.571
"To put my heart at ease."

00:06:00.453 --> 00:06:02.652
"Even if I have to ride a plane,
I'll do it."

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.630
"I need to do this."

00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:08.093
"I need this, Mateo."

00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:09.883
I need what?

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.546
- Mateo.

00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:12.732
- I need this, Mateo.

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.074
Oh, it's "I need this, Mateo."

00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:17.921
Are you done?

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:19.333
Alright.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.190
Let’s find the who, what, where.

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:24.539
- In a dark, hazy room.

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.600
Okay, in a dark and hazy room.

00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:30.407
Where is this?
Manila or Batanes?

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.064
- Manila.

00:06:31.093 --> 00:06:34.392
Of course, it says so in the dialogue.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.180
What's happening?

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:41.307
Carlo is just sitting in his room.

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:42.474
He's like...

00:06:43.828 --> 00:06:46.006
And he's thinking aloud.

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:49.870
He's contemplating
on his solitude.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.546
From what to where...

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.722
did the play or the scene go?

00:06:57.894 --> 00:07:03.780
In the beginning, he’s thinking about
how the relationship isn’t working.

00:07:04.008 --> 00:07:06.518
It's conflicting for him.

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.614
His last line was he needed
to do something about it.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.028
Carlo is the one talking, right?

00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.383
- But he’s by himself, right?

00:07:14.493 --> 00:07:15.195
- Yes.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.563
So he’s like saying
something to Mateo,

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.320
about their long distance
relationship.

00:07:20.383 --> 00:07:21.854
- Long distance.
- Separated.

00:07:21.993 --> 00:07:25.961
And he's going to find a way
so they can be together.

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:33.149
That’s the impression
of what Karlo wants to do.

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:38.218
I actually feel like he might be

00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:40.651
bordering towards suicide.

00:07:40.714 --> 00:07:41.383
- Wow.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.321
It tugs at your heart, right?

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:49.737
His smoking and drinking
are also factors.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.693
Okay, so it also establishes

00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:57.534
the character's disposition.

00:07:59.543 --> 00:08:03.520
One significant component
you should think about

00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:09.555
when you're describing an action
or what the character is doing,

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:16.738
is that the action should be performable.

00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:21.546
It means the actor
is capable of executing it.

00:08:22.194 --> 00:08:23.919
If she's going to sit,
she's going to sit.

00:08:24.517 --> 00:08:26.184
So active action?

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:27.470
Active action.

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:29.017
She could be thinking.

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.095
She sat down to think.

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:33.959
That's performable.

00:08:34.092 --> 00:08:36.361
Compared to when
you give instructions like

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:41.087
“She’s thinking of what she’ll do
for her birthday,"

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:46.397
"because it will happen
in two days.”

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.110
How will you perform that?

00:08:54.953 --> 00:08:57.422
She sat down to think.
That's acceptable.

00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:00.696
She sat down, thinking, in fear.

00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:02.634
That's performable.

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:09.482
But if you just describe what she'll do
and what she's thinking about,

00:09:09.644 --> 00:09:11.407
that's a bit hard to perform.

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:16.570
How did Carlo solve
that problem in his piece?

00:09:16.617 --> 00:09:24.731
Since his character
is sitting down, drunk, smoking...

00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:26.951
What did he do with the character?

00:09:27.213 --> 00:09:28.625
He did a monologue.

00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:32.113
And that's one of the reasons why

00:09:33.852 --> 00:09:35.950
dramatic writing is different.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:44.373
The actor is forced to do a monologue,
to let out his inner thoughts.

00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:51.850
By virtue of that,
you're already defying realism.

00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:59.684
It's very rare to see a person
sitting down saying,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.520
"You're so far away,"

00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:06.296
"I'm just here,
while you're over there."

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.666
"I don't know what I'm supposed to do."

00:10:11.714 --> 00:10:17.664
It’s either you’ll see that or think,

00:10:18.624 --> 00:10:20.561
"is she on the phone?"

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.787
or "is she talking to herself"?

00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:25.815
if you're using the realistic mode.

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:34.164
But then it’s a perfectly valid device
for a theatrical presentation.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:42.714
You’ll notice the writer is forced
to have the character speak her mind.

00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:44.752
She can't just think it.

00:10:45.336 --> 00:10:51.999
It has to manifest in the dialogue
or lines of the actor.

00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:56.331
The interaction of the action
and the dialogue

00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:59.859
is crucial in dramatic writing.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.758
Always remember that.

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:07.978
It's important
to make your character move.

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:09.212
Because that's the most--

00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:12.868
As we always say,
"Action speaks louder than words."

00:11:14.113 --> 00:11:19.853
It's more impactful
if a character stabs someone

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:21.241
rather than just saying,
"I'll kill you"

00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:22.881
because she already killed that person.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:31.160
That’s the power
of the action line in the script.

00:11:31.848 --> 00:11:40.101
Dialogue can do a lot of things.

00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:46.756
Number one, it determines
who is talking.

00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:53.454
A lawyer talks differently
from a ten-year-old child.

00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:57.629
An angel talks differently
from a demon.

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:04.312
The choice of words
defines a character.

00:12:04.422 --> 00:12:05.789
Aside from that,

00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:14.548
characters can also define
the style of the dialogue used.

00:12:16.683 --> 00:12:22.490
If it's poetic, the setting
could be from long ago.

00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:27.021
Though it can still be poetic today.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:29.716
There are musicals that use rap.

00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:39.598
But you know it's not realistic
because there's a rhythm to it.

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:48.093
There are plays that seem so real,
even when there's hardly any dialogue,

00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:51.669
because you can feel the tension.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:53.386
Next.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.218
The stage is dark and there's someone
knocking at the door.

00:12:56.273 --> 00:13:01.835
There's no sound onstage
and the knocking gets intense.

00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:05.064
Mauro gets up from the audience
wearing short shorts,

00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:08.225
an undershirt, and a bit of make up
while holding a ladle.

00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:10.563
The knocking gets louder.

00:13:10.727 --> 00:13:13.386
Mauro: "Wait, I'm already coming, my god!"

00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:15.947
Mauro heads for the door
at the center of the stage.

00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:18.729
He opens it with his back
facing the audience.

00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:25.813
He sees Father Victor
in jogging pants and a wet white shirt.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.179
Obviously coming from a workout.
Mauro is stunned and gulps.

00:13:30.204 --> 00:13:31.759
Mauro: "Let me guess,
you must be..."

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:33.115
Fr. Victor: "You're late."

00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:34.899
Mauro: "It wasn't that long."

00:13:34.924 --> 00:13:36.355
"Of course."

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.383
He rapidly says,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.525
"Gourmet sardines
with cold stir-fried rice

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.249
and some scrambled eggs
with freshly picked ripe tomatoes."

00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:44.744
Msgr. Cervantes: "What are those?"

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:48.803
Mauro: "Just sardines, fried rice, eggs,
and tomatoes fresh from the backyard."

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:51.080
Msgr. Cervantes: "Dios mio."

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:55.729
Fr. Victor: "It's good that
Mauro's here at the convent."

00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:58.531
"Although he's a bit rowdy,
at least it's cheerful here."

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:02.776
Mauro: "Cleanliness and orderliness
is next to godliness."

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:05.621
Fr. Victor: "You're so witty, Mauro.'

00:14:05.668 --> 00:14:07.412
Mauro: "Maureen, Father. Maureen."

00:14:07.474 --> 00:14:09.583
Msgr. Cervantes: "Maureen? It's Mauro!"

00:14:09.622 --> 00:14:12.173
"A name is sacred
and cannot be easily changed. "

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.292
"You were born as Mauro,
you will die as Mauro."

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:17.886
Mauro: "What if I don't like it, monsignor?"

00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:21.036
"Even Charice is Jake Zyrus now.
How conservative."

00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:23.148
"If you don't like Maureen,
I'll just be Maui then."

00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:24.656
"Maybe that will do?"

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.078
Msgr. Cervantes: "Coffee!"

00:14:30.335 --> 00:14:31.830
Where are we?

00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:33.808
Where does the scene take place?

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.258
- He said it's in the convent.

00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:36.386
Convent.

00:14:37.607 --> 00:14:41.869
What kind of convent is this?
Where is this convent?

00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:43.328
- Someone's wearing jogging pants.

00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:44.158
Next.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.670
- Setting: A mountain in Tanay.

00:14:46.723 --> 00:14:50.208
Woman: "It's so nice here.
The wind is cool, relaxing."

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.145
"Away from all the noise in the city.
It's so refreshing."

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:55.960
There's a voice over.
"It's so nice to jump, right?"

00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:56.970
- "Who's there?"

00:14:57.154 --> 00:15:01.781
"You can see everything from here.
The concrete buildings, the noise which mess up your life..."

00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:05.638
"They're far away from you
while you're here in complete solitude."

00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:08.333
"You'll get to see
even farther if you jump."

00:15:08.611 --> 00:15:11.011
- "What are you? A talking plant?"

00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:14.890
"No, I man the zipline.
Are you ready to go?"

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.190
The woman gets shocked.

00:15:19.775 --> 00:15:24.447
She gets shocked when she sees
the guy behind her.

00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:25.916
She is stunned.

00:15:25.974 --> 00:15:29.896
The guy is also taken aback
when their eyes meet.

00:15:30.077 --> 00:15:32.436
Voice over: "Are you ready to jump?"

00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:34.318
The woman smiles giddily.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.235
- "I'll jump if you come with me."

00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:37.332
The end.

00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:40.348
- Short and sweet.

00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:42.128
"That Thing Called Tadhana."

00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:54.282
The dialogue defines the style,
setting, atmosphere, mood

00:15:55.726 --> 00:16:03.910
character and rhythm
of the whole play.

00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:07.698
There are lengthy plays
with so many monologues.

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:09.875
The lines are really long.

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:14.978
There are also short
but staccato-like lines.

00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:17.635
“Yes no, no yes.”
Something like that.

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.665
It’s in the style you choose.

00:16:23.714 --> 00:16:31.002
In fact, you don’t actually need
fancy sets, right?

00:16:31.362 --> 00:16:34.175
Of course, it has its function now.

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:37.852
But for the basic unit of a scene,

00:16:38.004 --> 00:16:46.655
you just need dialogue
and action to create a play.
