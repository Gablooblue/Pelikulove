00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:15.762
We go back to the character.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:20.947
You're done with choosing
and thinking of what she wants,

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:24.096
and you've put her in the situation
she needs to deal with.

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:29.287
The important thing
you need to figure out

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.865
is the action
that the character will do

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:36.437
in order to move the story forward
and for her to reach the climax.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.169
What will she do?

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:45.372
It's important to answer
this question because

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:52.699
this will set the action
of the whole play.

00:00:53.392 --> 00:01:00.029
Is she like Hamlet who
contemplates for three hours

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:05.388
just to solidify the story
and to reach his end goal:

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:10.374
To kill his stepfather,

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:15.584
who is actually his uncle
who killed his real father?

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:28.107
Will the character devise
different strategies to keep us interested?

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:31.051
Will she get what she wants or not?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.847
Will she fall down the cliff
or not just to get there?

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:39.361
This will determine

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:45.413
if the play or literary piece
is plot-oriented or character-oriented

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.845
because it’s a mixture of both.

00:01:53.603 --> 00:02:00.826
Sometimes, our understanding
of the character becomes deeper

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:04.364
even though the story is short

00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:11.599
because the traits
of the character just emerge.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:19.081
Notice when characters
contemplate about the past,

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:21.743
significant things
usually happen in the past,

00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:23.280
and that’s when you
get to know the character.

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.207
Because of the past

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:28.116
the story stops.

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:32.904
When Jaclyn Jose does a monologue,

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:35.779
the story will slowly stop.

00:02:35.804 --> 00:02:39.742
Imagine a sinking rock,
going deeper and deeper.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.093
The deeper it gets,
the deeper you know about the character.

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:46.462
But nothing happens
because the character is telling a story.

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:48.148
Everything is on pause first.

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.287
If there’s a rally or a revolution happening,

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:54.293
it won’t happen yet
and the police won’t come yet.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:56.361
She needs to finish her story first.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.215
So the main story will stop.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:04.637
But there are some plays
that are filled with action

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.623
to the point where you’ll ask,
“Where is this going?”

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:09.699
“I don’t know her anymore.”

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:15.522
She’s always tripping,
getting caught, climbing, falling

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:18.031
to survive.

00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:25.344
The course of the story is linear,

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.541
but the depth...

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.943
it’s not as profound
as when characters have monologues.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:40.945
I’m going to give an example
on Marvel superheroes and DC.

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.457
The ones we see in movies.

00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:52.791
The DC characters
that Christopher Nolan formed are deep,

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:56.628
which is why it’s boring
for people who want action.

00:03:56.722 --> 00:04:02.116
The fighting has weight
because of the characters’ depth.

00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.909
In Marvel, there’s humor,

00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:07.331
but that’s the only thing
that carried their movies.

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:12.093
Of course, there are characters
who contemplate if they’re superheroes or not,

00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:17.779
but it’s only said in one hit,
and then it goes back to the action.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.697
So people are like that.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.537
People in 4DX are kind of like that.

00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:30.283
That’s the experience of the audience.

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:33.140
But if you look at the depth,

00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:35.350
this is it.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:39.207
Those with angst like this go deeper.

00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:44.045
Now, what balance
can you put in a play?

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:47.799
For example, in "Indigo Child,"

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.013
if you’ll watch it later,

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:54.386
bigger parts were reserved for the past.

00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:56.653
Revelation of the past.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.295
And if you look at the present action,

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:04.515
it’s not that huge.

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:08.340
The effect is it pulls you in deep.

00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:11.319
There’s a reason for that.

00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:13.790
You can use both to your advantage

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.954
or to your disaster,

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:20.523
to your catastrophe.

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:26.053
How will you choose?
How will you mix it?

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:28.289
In Chekhov’s plays,

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:31.526
almost all the characters

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:35.601
keep looking back to the past
and to faraway places.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:40.018
“I want to go to Moscow,
I want to go to Moscow,”

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:41.809
but the character’s just standing there.

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:46.409
To the point where you just
want to give him the fare to go.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.261
It pulls you in deep.

00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:52.480
Towards the end,

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:57.217
it’s either you’ll laugh at them
because you’re jerks

00:05:57.328 --> 00:06:02.475
or you’ll understand their dilemma.

00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:04.355
What is keeping them there?

00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:07.359
- So if it’s a musical,

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:14.229
the song either brings you deeper
into the plot or it drags the whole…?

00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:15.284
Exactly,

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.687
that’s why there’s such a thing
as musical dialogue.

00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:25.111
Because it can reach to a point
that the character has made a decision,

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:29.731
that if we notice

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.859
which Filipino musicals don’t often do.

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:37.734
Most of the time,
the songs in Filipino musicals are,

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.002
♫♪ This is my dream ♪♫

00:06:40.027 --> 00:06:43.403
♫♪ I want to be this,
that’s why everybody knows… ♪♫

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.952
The story stops there.

00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.330
It goes deeper but the action stops.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.034
Unlike Les Miserables,

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:57.867
♫♪ You are the one,
I’m not but you’re not… ♪♫

00:06:57.892 --> 00:06:59.791
Bag! Fall, run!

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.229
There’s action.

00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:06.047
The action moves forward
because they converse through songs.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:12.828
Since you got jukebox musical,
then it’s full of songs.

00:07:13.047 --> 00:07:14.584
There’s no dialogue.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.138
So for the most part,
the tendency is to ask,

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:21.356
“What song will fit here?”

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:26.397
If you include that,
that’s an opportunity for introspection.

00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:28.072
That could be

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:33.083
an advantage for some moments,
but it could also be a boring thing for others.

00:07:33.108 --> 00:07:36.255
That’s why it’s called a showstopper

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.624
because you stop the show

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:43.624
for the spectacle
of the choreography and so on.

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:45.559
It could be like,

00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:48.744
♫♪ There’s no business like show business! ♪♫

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:50.375
From “Annie Get Your Gun”

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.055
If you do it that way,

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.797
it will really stop,
and you’ll forget the story.

00:07:56.878 --> 00:08:01.039
“Ah, it’s so pretty, he’s good at singing…
What’s the story again?”

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.969
“Oh right he’s there,
he’s chasing it again.”

00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:08.618
That’s why it’s called showstoppers.

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.633
It’s what your character does on stage.

00:08:11.704 --> 00:08:15.686
It’s how he or she spends her time.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.659
This is where the skill of the writer comes in,

00:08:20.697 --> 00:08:25.879
how she’ll make use
of the character and plot,

00:08:26.624 --> 00:08:33.026
when she’ll stop
the main story to deepen things

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.871
in order to reveal the past

00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:40.361
which is still related
to what they’re chasing

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.870
so that when they reach the climax,

00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:47.605
we already got
carried away by the action

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:50.911
and we already got to know the characters.

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:58.179
because they already presented
the whole reason why she’s after that thing.

00:08:58.348 --> 00:09:02.944
Because in the 1950s,
she has this backstory.

00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.533
Because 10 years ago,
she loved someone.

00:09:07.957 --> 00:09:11.960
So, that’s what gives
depth and direction.

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.510
If you dive into one thing for too long,

00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:18.313
it may bore your audience

00:09:18.354 --> 00:09:21.164
or it might reach the point
where the story’s no longer interesting.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.611
You keep telling the story,
but you’re not doing anything

00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:32.579
or it’s filled with a lot of action to a point
where I don’t understand why it’s happening

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:39.685
because I don’t remember anymore
or you never said it was connected to the past.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:50.234
What the characters are doing
at any point in time in the play will set it—

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:55.003
they'll set the rhythm, the speed,

00:09:55.853 --> 00:10:04.017
or if it’s action, the depth,
and our knowledge of the characters.

00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:08.648
Of course, the most ideal thing
is when you don’t notice

00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:14.915
the character’s personality
unfolding inside the action.

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:19.255
That’s where you get to know her more
and why she’s doing those things

00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:23.929
Of course, it’s a bit difficult to do,
especially when it depends on the situation.

00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:38.765
These two set the atmosphere,
what she says, what story she’s telling.

00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:44.171
If what she’s going through
is full of drama and tragedy,

00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:50.132
especially if the audience
is moved by the character,

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:55.008
they’ll cry with her, pity her.

00:10:55.235 --> 00:11:00.513
But if all she knows is humor,
then we’ll laugh with her.

00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:04.246
She’s also the one who sets
the mood and atmosphere.

00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:05.824
And of course, I guess

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.882
the whole genre,
if it’s tragedy or comedy.

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:13.825
If you notice--

00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:19.258
I’ll take a small example
from Greek drama.

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:27.016
Oedipus’ situation
where there’s a massive plague.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.084
You already know the whole situation

00:11:31.577 --> 00:11:35.143
has an element of
expectation of drama,

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:40.011
especially when he says ,
“Let’s learn about the past.”

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:42.497
So he’ll find out about his past.

00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:48.594
Compared to "Lysistrata,"
a Greek play by Aristophanes

00:11:52.285 --> 00:11:56.206
Its setting is during a war
which is potentially tragic,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:03.346
but it’s actually humorous
because the women of that city

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.976
decided not to have sex
with their husbands

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:09.061
because their husbands
are too focused on the war.

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:13.484
Then all of a sudden,
what the characters choose,

00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:18.722
what they’ll do will set the tone—

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.621
if it’s light or heavy.

00:12:22.665 --> 00:12:30.197
"Lysistrata" is probably one of the first
sex comedies in the whole world.

00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:42.084
The style emerges from what we see
based on the characters’ actions and their response.
