WEBVTT

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.648
The First Night

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.491
I think I gained weight.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:54.804
Push!

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.470
There we go...

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:10.293
for a hotel ambiance.

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:12.282
How cheap!

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.268
Just joking, Lord.

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:18.905
It's too bright! Like there's a show.

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:41.428
What's up?

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:45.118
Silly!

00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:49.541
Aren't I pretty?

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.626
Off to ballroom?

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.884
Don’t be a killjoy!

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:00.994
Hey.

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.230
Les.

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.365
Thanks.

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:08.941
For checking my papers
for so many semesters.

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:12.789
Did anyone fail?

00:02:13.223 --> 00:02:14.856
Does anyone ever fail in your class?

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.309
Are you tired, Les?

00:02:22.478 --> 00:02:24.926
Well, you've always been like that.

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:28.011
When you're telling a joke,
it's like you're reciting in class.

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:31.255
When you're angry,
it's like you're doing the opening prayer.

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:35.313
Hey.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:38.652
Hey, are you sulking?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.303
Because I always ask you to check papers?

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.179
Your hand's callused again.

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:54.470
Don't worry.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:59.725
Your problem and calluses
will be over soon because...

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:04.839
Mr. Bautista says our school
is buying a Scantron machine.

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.138
Finally!

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.240
It's nothing.

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:09.750
The Scantron?

00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:12.031
Silly. Checking papers.

00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:16.059
Really? So what's wrong with you?

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:19.912
Wanna take a shit? The toilet's...

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.905
You're such a tease.

00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:24.668
That’s why you’re hooked on me.

00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:27.571
Yeah, 'cause you’re crazy.

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:32.909
Don't I remind you of someone?

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:37.791
Cherry Pie Picache?

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.587
Stupid! Adele!

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:41.065
Wait a minute.

00:03:41.907 --> 00:03:44.469
Just so you know,
she's way younger...

00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:47.175
Why? Do I look old?

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:48.471
Y-Yeah, w-why?

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:50.524
So? Cherry Pie's pretty!

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:54.260
It came straight from your mouth.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.380
That?

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.950
That I'm pretty.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.206
Hey!

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.139
- Hey!
- What?

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:11.131
Hey, Les, let's go home later.

00:04:13.142 --> 00:04:15.142
Hey, Les! What's up?

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:23.126
Nice! You finally got a textmate.

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:24.931
No, no. You're wrong.

00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:33.560
I was saying,
let's go home later.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.459
Us?

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.672
Yeah! We're going home together, right?

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:44.367
Don't we always go home together?

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.148
Is there a problem, Les?

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:52.126
Nothing really...

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:54.022
What is it?

00:04:54.452 --> 00:04:55.936
It's just...

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:59.303
Ma'am Debs, it's because...
I actually need to go now.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.706
Why? I ordered pizza.

00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:03.260
It's Hawaiian. Your favorite.

00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:05.229
That's not even enough for you.

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:08.582
Great!

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:09.595
So many high scores.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.976
Marlon Baldomero's the highest again.

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:14.074
He's really the complete package.

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.690
Cute and smart.

00:05:15.784 --> 00:05:18.159
I'll be going first, Ma'am Debs.

00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:20.764
I talked with my Mom.

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:25.116
The other night, Les.

00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:28.485
How is she?

00:05:29.535 --> 00:05:31.397
She was asking about you.

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:35.112
Anyway, so we talked and...

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.875
She said I'm not getting any younger.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.383
Just heavier.

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:42.605
And that I've been taking care of her
for some time now.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.527
She's being so dramatic!

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:45.961
And that...

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:47.971
years have already passed.

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:53.625
Most of my students
have gone abroad, if not married.

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:56.848
Meanwhile...I'm just here.

00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:57.941
Still single.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.048
What about Sir Sam at computer lab?

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:07.025
In fairness to you, Les,
that's your best joke.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.192
Hello?

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:10.857
What can Sam and I talk about?

00:06:10.882 --> 00:06:13.056
Storage capacity of flash drives?

00:06:13.217 --> 00:06:16.657
And what will we bond over?
Trouble-shooting computer issues?

00:06:16.832 --> 00:06:19.089
Yeah! Awesome, right!

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.607
You're made for each other.

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.688
Uy! Sir Sam!

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:27.655
Mom asked if I was ever going to get married.

00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:30.302
If this was an exam,
my time was already up.

00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:32.402
I told her, "No chance, Mom. I failed."

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:33.927
Wait a minute.

00:06:33.964 --> 00:06:36.036
Didn't you tell me before,

00:06:36.183 --> 00:06:38.631
by the time you reach 40,

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:39.668
you'll give up.

00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:41.486
I'm not 40 yet, Les.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:42.366
Wow.

00:06:44.216 --> 00:06:47.334
Mom asked about my relationship with you.

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:49.201
Huh? What?

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:50.076
It's...

00:06:50.194 --> 00:06:52.080
Former student.

00:06:52.448 --> 00:06:53.607
Friend.

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.655
Come on, Les.

00:06:56.002 --> 00:06:57.111
Don't play dumb.

00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:02.632
I could always count on you
to raise your hand in class.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.584
Do we have to play Charades for this?

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.178
Ma'am Debs.

00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:09.639
Look...

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.545
Candles...

00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:13.540
Red wine.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.418
I won this at the Christmas party raffle.

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:18.156
Plastic cups? Really?

00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:19.697
Isn't it romantic, Les?

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:20.413
Oh no!

00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:21.283
Oh yes!

00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:22.262
Don't tell me.

00:07:22.287 --> 00:07:23.254
I will.

00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:24.310
This can't be.

00:07:24.335 --> 00:07:27.041
Don't speak in English.
You're not a celebrity.

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:27.990
Debs.

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:29.885
No.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:34.748
So, I'm mistaken?

00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:40.720
Every time you part my hair
when it reaches your face, what was that?

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:42.739
It's messy so it needs to be fixed!

00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:44.367
What about those movie dates?

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:46.940
When you don't remove your arms
when it touches my boobs?

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:49.222
But that’s normal!
The cinema’s cramped.

00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:51.433
Our bodies are bound to touch.

00:07:51.523 --> 00:07:52.313
Ma'am Debs.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:56.757
Think of the thousands of bodies
accidentally groped at the train everyday.

00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.238
One woman chimed she'd be pregnant
by the time she got off.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.207
What about the texts
we exchange everyday?

00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:02.431
The constant calls?

00:08:02.455 --> 00:08:05.103
Me telling you my problems?
You telling me yours?

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:06.108
- That's nothing?
- Ma'am Debs.

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:08.347
Friends do that for each other.

00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:11.615
Mom asked if you were my boyfriend.

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:15.258
I don't want it to come from me.

00:08:16.903 --> 00:08:21.594
But I told her, every time
you picked up test papers for checking,

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:24.191
I always felt excited.

00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:29.180
Like you wanted to spare me
from getting callused from checking papers.

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:29.757
I feel--

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:32.912
But I've been checking papers for you
since I was your student!

00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:36.068
But you're not my student anymore!

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.931
Ma'am Debs.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.572
You're an important part of my life.

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:44.051
Ma'am Debbie!

00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:47.631
Remember the time

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:51.217
when I felt so small
every time I entered the classroom,

00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:53.219
you always boosted my confidence.

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:55.788
When you became
my psychology professor,

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.163
I was so inspired.

00:08:57.196 --> 00:09:00.287
I realized studying was worthwhile.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.361
To be honest, Ma'am Debs,

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.490
you bring out the best in me.

00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:06.795
- But what you're telling me is--
- Is it because I'm fat?

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:09.097
I didn't say that.

00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:11.295
You know we go for places
that serve unlimited rice.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.566
I already ordered slimming tea
from Ms. Bañares.

00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:14.733
I'll be sexy in one month.

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:16.671
You don't have to do that.

00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:18.920
And those slimming teas aren't safe!

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.295
Okay. Alright. Uh...

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.823
I've signed up for zumba classes.

00:09:23.847 --> 00:09:25.288
If you want, I'll also do yoga.

00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:26.472
Go ahead.

00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:29.475
Do it for your health.

00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:33.284
Is it because of our age gap?

00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:35.118
It's not that obvious.

00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:37.643
We both like the same food.

00:09:37.668 --> 00:09:40.245
We laugh at the same jokes.

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.531
We accept each other's quirks.

00:09:42.555 --> 00:09:43.471
Ma'am Debs.

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:45.237
Ma'am Debs, please!

00:09:45.647 --> 00:09:50.231
Les, can't you really see?

00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:52.998
You really don't feel anything?

00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:56.465
All the things I've learned
from all sorts of teaching strategies,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.356
I've poured them all here!

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.108
Sorry.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:14.581
All this time,

00:10:14.643 --> 00:10:16.743
I was just imagining things.

00:10:17.697 --> 00:10:20.121
Even if we've been like this for so long,

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:22.157
I'm still just Ma'am Debs.

00:10:23.098 --> 00:10:26.868
Your personality development coach,
teacher, mentor, what else?

00:10:27.647 --> 00:10:29.044
Trisha and I are together.

00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:32.901
What?

00:10:34.195 --> 00:10:35.359
Trisha's my girlfriend.

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.095
Trisha. Trisha Catacutan.

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:39.854
Yes, I know her!
You were both in my class.

00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:41.679
Why, Lester?

00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:44.369
What do you mean why?
I'm a guy. She's a girl.

00:10:44.407 --> 00:10:45.970
And I'm what?

00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:47.878
A girl, too.

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:49.738
A female teacher.

00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:52.621
Whenever I read her name
during roll call before,

00:10:52.646 --> 00:10:56.671
you always bowed your head
as if she smelled unbearable.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:59.131
It turns out I shouldn't be afraid of her.

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:00.979
And she smells nice.

00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:02.790
And I remember you said,

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:07.410
it turned you off that she barely passed
such easy exams!

00:11:07.514 --> 00:11:09.129
I can always teach her.

00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:11.222
And she's improved, you know.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:14.263
Actually, she helped me
check your papers.

00:11:14.377 --> 00:11:16.756
You let her check it?

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:17.558
Yes. So?

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:20.544
I'm going to recheck it!
I'm sure she made lots of mistakes.

00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:24.302
That's mean, Ma'am Debs.

00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:35.153
How long have you been together?

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:38.906
One month tomorrow.

00:11:58.112 --> 00:11:59.228
Ma'am Debs.

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:02.411
Ma'am Debs, sorry.

00:12:02.706 --> 00:12:04.752
It's unfair, Les.

00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:07.676
You didn't even tell me.

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:12.745
If I didn't tell you what I felt tonight,
I might've learned about it from someone else.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.969
I thought we were allies.

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:21.129
I thought we could be
honest with each other.

00:12:21.168 --> 00:12:22.652
You didn't even tell me.

00:12:22.986 --> 00:12:25.108
I was going to tell you.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.120
And...

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.308
See, look at your reaction.

00:12:30.762 --> 00:12:33.993
Okay, Les.
You said you had to leave first.

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:37.895
Ma'am Debs.

00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:39.510
Will you be okay?

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.101
Dumbass.

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:44.588
As if you don't know me!

00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:45.916
I'll be fine.

00:12:46.993 --> 00:12:48.458
With these looks?

00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:50.543
And this outfit?

00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:57.067
Ma'am Debs. Sorry.

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:58.871
Hey, you've got a girlfriend!

00:12:59.454 --> 00:13:00.509
Just go.

00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:03.157
Go!

00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:07.891
Happy one-month!

00:13:08.377 --> 00:13:10.795
Best wishes!

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:13.121
Sweet dreams!

00:13:13.317 --> 00:13:14.472
J.A.P.A.N.!

00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:16.620
Just Always Pray At Night!

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.006
I.T.A.L.Y.!

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.192
I Trust And Love You!

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.011
K.A.Z.A.K.H.S.T.A.N.!

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:23.738
Shit, nevermind.

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:26.211
C'mon...don't be that way.

00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:31.166
Go! Before you change your mind.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.508
Hello?

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:05.204
Isn't the pizza ready yet?

00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:07.148
I called hours ago.

00:14:07.173 --> 00:14:10.913
I already lost my appetite!

00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:18.322
Just cancel my order, miss.

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:28.102
Of course, I am overjoyed for Lester.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.301
Lester regularly buys siomai rice here.

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:35.182
He's very hardworking, just a bit shy.

00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:41.695
Lots of girls like him
but he always rejects them.

00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:43.956
Good thing he's settled down.

00:15:48.357 --> 00:15:49.963
It took a while, bro.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.698
I had to squeeze the story out of him.

00:15:54.322 --> 00:15:57.016
He said it all started in the lab.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.258
That's what he said.

00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:00.910
I said, "Really now?"

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.429
Actually, it's like this...

00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:07.675
Trisha broke a test tube.
She was in tears.

00:16:07.827 --> 00:16:11.408
Lester here came to her rescue.

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:15.666
Maybe it was destiny.

00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:18.336
'Cause I know...

00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:21.107
Lester was often seen
with someone else before.

00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:29.120
Actually, we were classmates since freshman year.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:32.137
At first, I didn't think I'd like him.

00:16:32.223 --> 00:16:35.535
He was somewhat of a nerd at first.

00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:38.168
And he'd always be with his teacher.

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:40.730
What's her name again?

00:16:40.862 --> 00:16:42.796
The psych prof...

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.877
Ah! Ms. Debbie!

00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:46.733
Ma'am Debs!
Yeah, her.

00:16:57.582 --> 00:17:01.825
The Second Night

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.813
Excuse me.

00:17:20.067 --> 00:17:23.879
Is Cherry Pie Picache around?

00:17:24.129 --> 00:17:26.749
I mean, Adele?

00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:28.551
Lester.

00:17:30.203 --> 00:17:32.257
I was just trying my luck
that you might be here.

00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:35.964
I was told you always
go home early, Ma'am Debs.

00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:38.318
No, I just have a lot of work.

00:17:39.185 --> 00:17:41.983
Ma'am Debs, you won't get married that way!

00:17:45.452 --> 00:17:47.692
What's up? What brings you here?

00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:50.527
Maybe you don't want to see me.

00:17:54.498 --> 00:17:57.726
I need a recommendation letter.

00:17:57.924 --> 00:17:59.148
For what?

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:02.663
For work.

00:18:03.769 --> 00:18:04.952
At a call center.

00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:10.912
I took the offer,

00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:15.703
while my application
at the hospital is still pending.

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:18.493
So I can also...

00:18:18.853 --> 00:18:20.634
save money for training.

00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:22.466
In fact,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.738
the pay's actually bigger there.

00:18:25.075 --> 00:18:27.479
I can even practice my English.

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:29.627
You know what I mean, don't you?

00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:35.743
Ma'am Debs!

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.086
I thought you said
the school had a Scantron?

00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:42.685
There is one, but it's unreliable.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:48.926
Firstly, the circle must be fully shaded
so the machine can read it.

00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:51.904
But an issue came up.

00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:56.451
Sam had been showing
the answer key to his student friends.

00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.259
Until one day, the machine broke down.

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:00.903
When it was investigated,

00:19:03.006 --> 00:19:05.132
turns out the machine
was second-hand.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.545
So that's why!

00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:18.936
I heard downstairs
that Sir Bau wasn't here anymore.

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:20.057
Mhm.

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:22.530
A lot of cases were filed against him.

00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:25.596
Ma'am Debs!

00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:28.932
I bumped into Sir Palubs at the gate.

00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:32.750
Did you greet him?
It's the sucker's birthday today.

00:19:33.156 --> 00:19:34.612
No...

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.087
But that's okay.

00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:39.598
He never remembers my name either.

00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:41.496
You still can't get over that?

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.102
It's just Lester.

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:46.102
I would understand
if my name was Nebuchadnezzar.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.964
That's the point.

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:51.178
It's so simple that's why it's forgettable.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.924
You know, I still remember,

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:56.568
one time, we rode the jeep together.

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:59.076
I paid for his fare.

00:19:59.212 --> 00:20:01.675
I said, "Sir, this one's on me."

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:03.822
We chatted the whole time.

00:20:04.126 --> 00:20:07.355
He wanted to gossip about my classmates.

00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:13.423
About who was dating the girl
with the big boobs at the front row.

00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:17.789
About that activist-classmate
who refuses to have a haircut.

00:20:17.836 --> 00:20:19.928
Anyway, we talked about many things.

00:20:20.032 --> 00:20:22.368
And then he asked,

00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:24.802
"So where are you getting off, Leslie?"

00:20:25.317 --> 00:20:27.425
At least he got the first syllable right.

00:20:28.439 --> 00:20:29.444
Point taken.

00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:38.788
Ma'am Debs, what about Ma'am Alma?

00:20:39.224 --> 00:20:40.397
Is she still around?

00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:42.892
Virginia Ajero?

00:20:42.955 --> 00:20:44.106
You got it.

00:20:44.916 --> 00:20:48.001
The teacher who had a collection
of Alma Moreno jokes.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.808
Whenever she sensed the class was bored,

00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:55.004
she'd blurt out an Alma Moreno joke.

00:20:55.209 --> 00:21:02.753
My favorite was when Alma Moreno
went to McDonald's to order a Big Mac.

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:04.865
Of course, the crew asked her,

00:21:05.072 --> 00:21:07.960
"Ma'am, is this for dine-in or for take out?"

00:21:08.364 --> 00:21:10.917
Alma got irritated and said,

00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:13.696
"No! It's for my son, Vandolph!"

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.840
She told those jokes
even in the faculty room.

00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:22.115
One time, Alma was with her BFF at Mcdonald's,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.800
but Alma was the only one
who ordered a Big Mac.

00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:29.452
Naturally, Alma felt self-conscious,
so she offered her friend a bite.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:32.729
Her friend said, "Thanks, I'm a vegetarian."

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:35.350
Alma was amazed and replied,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.958
"Oh, I'm a Capricorn!"

00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:45.050
Anyway, Ma'am Alma's no longer
affiliated with the school.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.721
She said there was no
career growth in this school.

00:21:48.272 --> 00:21:49.787
All for the best.

00:21:49.812 --> 00:21:54.251
So other students could hear
her Alma Moreno jokes.

00:21:56.853 --> 00:21:58.638
Ma'am Debs, what about...

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.194
Ma'am Filipino? Is she still here?

00:22:03.556 --> 00:22:04.705
Jelly Vinta.

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:05.802
Yes, her.

00:22:05.832 --> 00:22:09.227
I had fun in her class.

00:22:10.098 --> 00:22:11.946
Really?

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.746
Wasn't she boring?

00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:16.697
All she ever did was read.
Books are her best friends.

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:18.565
No.

00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:23.652
I found her amusing 'cause she spoke
as if she were reciting a poem.

00:22:23.853 --> 00:22:27.994
One afternoon,
she walked into the classroom...

00:22:28.064 --> 00:22:33.105
"Class, have you ever stared
at the sky just before a rainfall?"

00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:36.878
"Don't you think
it looks like a bruised cheek?"

00:22:38.152 --> 00:22:39.824
How witty!

00:22:41.503 --> 00:22:44.084
You know, one time,

00:22:44.109 --> 00:22:48.745
We also discussed
"Veneration Without Understanding" by Constantino.

00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:51.290
Ma’am Vinta said, "Class,"

00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:54.623
"If we were to think about
Constantino’s reasoning,"

00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:57.631
"Rizal is not the essence of the revolution."

00:22:57.695 --> 00:23:01.605
"Rizal was only a button,
not the entire polo shirt."

00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:05.498
I always wrote her quotable quotes
in my notebook.

00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:12.215
I remember, you lost that notebook
and refused to go home until we found it.

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:16.968
You must have been afraid
someone would discover your weirdness.

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:17.968
Alright!

00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:23.022
Bur of course, no one can beat
my Psychology professor.

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.855
The twin sister of Adele?

00:23:24.957 --> 00:23:26.981
She was the best! Awesome!

00:23:27.028 --> 00:23:29.808
Stop it, Lester Quizon.

00:23:30.089 --> 00:23:32.612
Wow, you had to say my full name?

00:23:32.636 --> 00:23:34.427
At least not Leslie.

00:23:37.545 --> 00:23:40.023
Ma'am Debs, don't you notice anything?

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:43.229
Nothing in particular.

00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:44.733
Really?

00:23:45.312 --> 00:23:48.350
Oh! You look different.

00:23:49.147 --> 00:23:50.499
I look handsome, right?

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:55.672
Where's the audition?
Are you playing "extra" somewhere?

00:23:59.787 --> 00:24:02.804
It's getting late. Aren't you going home?

00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:09.681
Just a moment.

00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:13.803
Why did you really come here?

00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:17.712
Is this the answer key?

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.012
You know what, Ma'am Debs,

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.039
I missed so many things.

00:24:33.398 --> 00:24:37.910
The cafeteria food
that tastes like meals for patients.

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:44.046
Sitting in the corridor
while waiting for the next class,

00:24:44.206 --> 00:24:47.547
not minding if I get
my white uniform dirty.

00:24:48.277 --> 00:24:52.841
The smell of the wet market
as I pass by on my way to and from school.

00:24:53.051 --> 00:24:55.030
- I miss...
- How are you, Les?

00:24:56.614 --> 00:24:58.009
What do you mean?

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.361
You tell me.

00:25:01.464 --> 00:25:04.700
Amazing, Ma'am Debs.
The paper I'm checking has no mistakes.

00:25:04.725 --> 00:25:07.167
I noticed you've been talkative.

00:25:07.312 --> 00:25:09.503
I know when you're usually like that.

00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:14.022
I'm okay, Ma'am Debs. I'm happy.

00:25:14.573 --> 00:25:15.706
Good.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.219
I'll go ahead, Les.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:20.649
You can still hang around if you want to.

00:25:20.876 --> 00:25:21.939
Huh?

00:25:26.122 --> 00:25:27.330
It hasn't been easy.

00:25:32.004 --> 00:25:34.429
Trisha and I have a kid.
He's turning two.

00:25:35.058 --> 00:25:36.375
That's great.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:37.893
You must be happy.

00:25:37.917 --> 00:25:41.319
Look at me, I've grown old
taking care of my nephews and nieces.

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:43.194
It's really wonderful.

00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:45.480
Especially it's your own child.

00:25:45.774 --> 00:25:46.819
Yes, it's been fun.

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:49.832
He’s already become talkative
even if he can’t say the words right.

00:25:50.218 --> 00:25:51.545
No problem then.

00:25:52.492 --> 00:25:53.805
But, Trish is...

00:25:54.707 --> 00:25:55.813
What about Trish?

00:25:58.042 --> 00:25:59.540
We're not happy.

00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:06.077
We're not the type to throw plates
at each other when we fight.

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:12.171
If anything, I can count with one hand
the times we raised our voices at each other.

00:26:12.743 --> 00:26:15.125
But you know,

00:26:15.257 --> 00:26:17.392
I know, we’re not happy.

00:26:18.862 --> 00:26:20.479
Give it time, Les.

00:26:21.052 --> 00:26:24.747
Maybe you're still adjusting to each other.

00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:27.743
I don’t know, Ma’am Debs.

00:26:28.284 --> 00:26:29.426
You know, it's like...

00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:33.403
When we're at the mall,
we look at different things.

00:26:33.462 --> 00:26:35.722
That's natural.
You’re a guy. She’s a girl.

00:26:35.747 --> 00:26:38.014
You should be worried
if you like the same things.

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:39.167
That's not it.

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:43.658
You know me.
I prefer simple and affordable things.

00:26:44.121 --> 00:26:45.580
Her tastes are so expensive.

00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:47.435
This polo shirt...

00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:51.616
She forced me to buy this
so I'd look fashionable.

00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:54.532
Then again you said
you look handsome in that shirt.

00:26:54.638 --> 00:26:55.748
According to you.

00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:58.982
Whenever we watch rom-coms,

00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:02.339
I’d be excited over a scene,
while she'd stare at it blankly.

00:27:03.124 --> 00:27:06.231
'Cause when you get excited,
it doesn’t show.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.341
And when she’d bring me to her art films,

00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:12.988
just 10 minutes and I'm knocked out.

00:27:13.196 --> 00:27:15.225
It's so boring

00:27:15.262 --> 00:27:17.481
even with an energy drink.

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:20.403
- You have so many complaints, Les.
- That's not all.

00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:21.864
When it comes to food,

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:24.693
you know I want unlimited rice.

00:27:25.199 --> 00:27:27.602
She prefers salads.

00:27:27.657 --> 00:27:28.397
Shit.

00:27:28.422 --> 00:27:29.506
Salad?

00:27:29.507 --> 00:27:34.099
She must be the vegetarian friend
in Ma’am Ajero's Alma Moreno jokes.

00:27:36.557 --> 00:27:37.865
How about this, Les,

00:27:38.274 --> 00:27:41.866
go back to the reasons why you liked her.

00:27:42.072 --> 00:27:43.670
You told me before,

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:47.657
"I shouldn't be afraid of her
even if 'Catacutan' was her surname."

00:27:47.776 --> 00:27:49.941
and you also said that

00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:55.164
you were willing to be with her
even if you didn't have the same wavelength.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.487
I don't know, Ma'am Debs.

00:27:57.785 --> 00:27:59.220
Sometimes,

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.242
she caught me lost in thought
and asked me if I had a problem.

00:28:03.471 --> 00:28:06.223
She said, "Les, is there a problem?"

00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:07.993
What did you tell her?

00:28:08.098 --> 00:28:09.042
Nothing.

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.504
What could I say?

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.911
How could I answer? or explain?

00:28:14.158 --> 00:28:15.693
It's like there's...

00:28:15.758 --> 00:28:17.899
there’s this pain in your body but,

00:28:17.928 --> 00:28:20.585
but you can’t pinpoint where,
you can't even describe it?

00:28:21.112 --> 00:28:24.971
It’s not just because of our differences,

00:28:25.178 --> 00:28:27.612
when we go out, watch movies or eat out.

00:28:28.031 --> 00:28:30.701
Those are superficial things.

00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:34.926
I don’t know what to say, Les.

00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:39.055
You know, Ma'am Debs,

00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:42.072
I missed so many things…

00:28:42.428 --> 00:28:44.100
I missed this.

00:28:44.153 --> 00:28:46.601
Our conversations.

00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:51.247
When we talked,

00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:55.820
we would laugh or get shocked
or get mad at the same things.

00:28:55.922 --> 00:29:01.179
That even if we repeat
the same joke or story,

00:29:01.338 --> 00:29:03.230
we still don't get tired of it.

00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:08.349
I'm so touched.
I hate you, Boy.

00:29:08.843 --> 00:29:10.317
You know, Ma'am Debs?

00:29:10.342 --> 00:29:13.357
When I needed a recommendation letter for work,

00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:15.220
I immediately thought of you.

00:29:15.322 --> 00:29:17.290
But I also hesitated.

00:29:17.936 --> 00:29:20.260
'Cause what would you say?

00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:22.974
"To whom it may concern,"

00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:29.748
"I met Lester Quizon
when he was an anti-social freshman"

00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:32.862
"I approached and befriended him."

00:29:32.952 --> 00:29:38.980
"Slowly, I taught him how
to believe in himself and his potential."

00:29:39.382 --> 00:29:41.866
"Lester Quizon is very helpful."

00:29:41.904 --> 00:29:43.816
"He helped me check papers."

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.282
"He’s even better
than the Scantron machine."

00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:48.755
"But,"

00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.456
"But it seems like"

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.026
"he's just good at checking papers."

00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:57.408
"Because in other things,"

00:29:57.985 --> 00:30:01.533
"he's just like a second-hand Scantron,"

00:30:02.112 --> 00:30:06.477
"The answer's already there,
but he still couldn't read it and left."

00:30:06.558 --> 00:30:07.845
"He left her hanging."

00:30:07.904 --> 00:30:11.240
Let’s not open old wounds, Les.
Two years have passed.

00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:13.637
I got pressured, Ma’am Debs.

00:30:13.662 --> 00:30:14.269
Stop it!

00:30:14.293 --> 00:30:16.398
I knew all along. I felt it, too.

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:19.928
But I avoided it like a student
scared of the exam even if I knew the answers.

00:30:19.953 --> 00:30:22.803
- I said, stop!
- I got scared, Ma'am Debs.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.666
That’s why I shifted my attention
to Trisha, to her beauty.

00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:27.096
I gave in to superficiality.

00:30:27.121 --> 00:30:30.816
- I told myself that my classmates would be impressed...
- Is this what you went here for?

00:30:30.841 --> 00:30:32.880
- I thought that if we got married...
- I'll call the guard!

00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:33.429
-  I would forget…
- Lester!

00:30:33.454 --> 00:30:35.249
- I love you!
- Lester!

00:30:36.154 --> 00:30:37.472
I love you.

00:30:39.511 --> 00:30:40.605
Sorry.

00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:46.325
There you go again.

00:30:46.687 --> 00:30:48.411
Saying sorry.

00:30:49.161 --> 00:30:53.939
For once in your life, Les,
make a stand!

00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:56.728
I’m already fine!

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.353
Would you believe that?

00:30:58.922 --> 00:31:02.776
Yes, I was angry. At you, at myself.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.288
I was mad at why I was fat,
why I was single at 38.

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:08.589
I was mad at why I was your teacher
and you were my student,

00:31:08.613 --> 00:31:12.686
and that of all the places in the world,
we met in this school.

00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:17.321
But that night and other nights have passed.

00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:20.162
I have no regrets.

00:31:20.706 --> 00:31:24.399
I have no regrets about what I did
and what happened.

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:28.086
Even if we didn’t end up together,
it was enough that I told you —

00:31:31.652 --> 00:31:33.944
I love you, Ma'am Debs.

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.028
I love you, Debbie.

00:31:43.971 --> 00:31:46.024
I have to go.

00:31:59.524 --> 00:32:02.274
I’m getting married, Les.

00:32:03.635 --> 00:32:05.141
In a month.

00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:09.768
I wasn’t counting on it.

00:32:10.824 --> 00:32:13.158
After all, I’m already 40.

00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:16.021
But then,

00:32:16.662 --> 00:32:17.834
he came along.

00:32:17.872 --> 00:32:22.498
I'm just not able to ask him
to check papers.

00:32:26.564 --> 00:32:28.062
Bye.
