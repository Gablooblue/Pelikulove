00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:15.109
At this point, you should know
that the word “playwright",

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:17.423
in fact,

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:21.094
was used as a form of insult.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:27.301
The one who coined the term "playwright"

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.183
was Ben Jonson.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.120
A renaissance--

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:35.418
He didn’t see himself as a playwright,
but as a renaissance poet.

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:48.913
He wanted to separate the real poets
from the lowly writers aspiring to be poets.

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:52.651
Because Ben Jonson,
like Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe,

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:57.814
they wrote dramatic poetry
for themselves as dramatists.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:02.357
When their work is produced,
we know it's for the king.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.594
They were known as poets.

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:11.910
Shakespeare was a poet or at least
was considered as a poet at that time.

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:17.826
Ben Jonson used the term
"playwright" to say,

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.701
"You are not a poet."

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:25.582
"You're just a playwright.
You only know how to construct a play."

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.232
"You don't have a way with words."

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:34.688
The "wright" in playwright
does not mean "to write".

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.790
Notice that the spelling is w-r-i-g-h-t
as in “shipwright”.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:47.137
A shipwright makes ships.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.562
Or a millwright makes machines.

00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:54.776
A plowwright makes plows.

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:59.608
A playwright only makes plays.
You construct a play.

00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:00.830
You don't write

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:02.792
because you're not
"good with words".

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:06.733
Today, we all know
that the modern playwright

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:11.565
doesn’t have to be poetic
or to write poetry,

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:18.194
especially given the many forms
of plays and styles and genres.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.319
When the age of realism took place,

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:27.220
the playwright’s reason
for writing changed.

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:35.173
It's no longer just to write poetry,
but to let ordinary people's voices be heard

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:40.133
and to show how
they talk on stage.

00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:42.182
When realism came along,

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:49.558
the playwright's work couldn't be labeled
as "poetry" in the strictest sense.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.248
Eventually, the word evolved.
Writers like me,

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:58.015
we accepted being called playwrights.

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:01.506
And we made it...

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:08.632
Respectable.
If you can call this a respectable career.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:13.348
Like for example,
one of my mentors, Rene Villanueva

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.545
He started as a poet.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:23.757
He joined a group of poets.

00:03:23.973 --> 00:03:30.070
He kept on writing poetry
until a colleague told him,

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.802
“You’re not a poet,
you’re only a playwright.”

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:39.345
As if repeating what Ben Jonson said
hundreds of years ago.

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:42.685
Rene accepted that.

00:03:43.692 --> 00:03:51.134
And he became one of the most important
playwrights in the Philippines.

00:03:51.937 --> 00:04:00.397
So playwriting found its own place
in the field of drama and literature.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.217
Amazing, right?

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:09.401
It’s like the playwright
is standing on two different fields.

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:15.486
Now, how is this important?

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:24.375
Being a playwright doesn’t mean
accepting the insult of being in words.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:30.767
In fact, the playwriting tradition formed
and developed itself throughout the world

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.110
because it thoroughly found
different strategies to use language.

00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.414
Finding different forms of speech,

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:51.800
several ways on what the characters can say,
through actors.

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:57.457
The playwriting tradition
created different language strategies.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.227
Even here in the country.

00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:07.541
Actually, the whole history of playwriting
is really filled with revelations

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:15.476
and an evolution of different forms
of language strategies.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:24.385
This is for you to set up
an emotional impact for the audience.

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:39.353
We know that this kind of tradition
of playwriting is modern.

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:44.510
This started from the colonizers
who arrived in the country.

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:54.136
Besides that,
it created its own category.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.014
that's different
from writing a novel.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:06.395
Novelists can write what I call logorrhea,
the diarrhea of words.

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:08.984
You can write anything
with great length.

00:06:10.822 --> 00:06:17.515
But you can get lost in the written words
because it's only being read.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:18.258
Okay?

00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:21.837
Not just read,
but because it’s being read.

00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:26.610
When you’re sleepy
or you need to eat

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:30.588
or you need to fetch your child,
you have to put the book down.

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.628
When a play is performed,

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:41.127
you can't just leave and come back.

00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:47.250
If you don’t like what’s happening,
you walk out.

00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:49.955
The theater can't be closed for you.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.379
Unlike theater,
reading is a personal experience.

00:06:54.408 --> 00:06:56.230
You don’t need people
when you read.

00:06:56.286 --> 00:07:03.661
Watching a play requires an audience
to watch the whole thing.

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.664
That’s the difference in intention.

00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:15.086
When writing for a play,
you need to know the intention.

00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:23.001
One of the pros and cons
if you’re a novelist

00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:28.133
if what you wrote is bad,
there's no one to blame but you.

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:34.974
But if you’re a playwright,
you can blame the director, the actor.

00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:37.325
You just have to prove
that you’re right

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.952
by making a new version
of the play you wrote.

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.423
“It's supposed to be this way.”
Right?

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:44.796
So that's it.

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:47.626
It's also different from writing a film

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.458
by the very same reason.

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.158
When you make a film,

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.342
I'm a screenwriter,
but I'll say this nevertheless.

00:07:57.572 --> 00:08:03.939
screenwriters are not
the ones in control of the film

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.412
It’s really a director’s medium.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.954
The root of film is photography,

00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:15.897
which is why the visual is supreme.

00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:18.995
Maybe we'll find out
along the way

00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:24.838
that's where a disjunct
occurs at times.

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:30.915
For example, when a playwright like me
will enter into screenwriting

00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:33.448
and vice-versa.

00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:39.859
For example, in Jmee's scene
where there's a "voice over."

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:45.815
Voice over is relatively
more cinematic than theatrical.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:52.695
If you watch the plays from long ago,

00:08:53.018 --> 00:08:55.923
the voice-over is rarely used.

00:08:56.047 --> 00:08:58.202
But that's because microphones
didn't exist yet.

00:08:58.694 --> 00:09:00.101
So you have to shout it out loud.

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:04.751
At the same time, it's unheard of
when you're a director

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:06.802
who's unfamiliar
with the concept of cinema,

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:09.471
why would you do a voice-over
when a person's already there?

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.512
Just put her on top.

00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.609
If she's supposed to be god,
then god should be there talking.

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:16.423
That's why I asked you, right?

00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:19.411
Let's say the character is alone
and then she hears something.

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:20.799
She doesn't know who.

00:09:20.964 --> 00:09:23.712
Suddenly, when she turns around,
she's face to face with someone.

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:29.612
If you notice the consciousness of the writing,
it's cinematic.

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:33.390
It requires, for it to be the
most effective way of saying it,

00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:34.862
it requires a cut.

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:36.942
It requires a cutaway, right?

00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:39.124
When you turn around,
it's like oh you're already there!

00:09:39.189 --> 00:09:43.119
But in theater, the actor
is forced to enter the stage.

00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:47.900
So even before she speaks,
the punchline is already given away.

00:09:47.977 --> 00:09:48.985
Something like that.

00:09:49.218 --> 00:09:51.839
That's the difference.

00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:54.320
Always take note of that.

00:09:54.888 --> 00:09:59.546
I think you'll realize the importance
of how you're going to write this

00:09:59.613 --> 00:10:06.708
based from where the craft of playwriting
and screenwriting came from.

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:09.512
Playwriting goes way, way back

00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:11.663
while screenwriting is much recent.

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:18.130
So these are the differences
and similarities of playwriting to poetry.
