WEBVTT

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.073
Next, of course, will be,
always and ever,

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:18.278
comedy and

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.311
drama.

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:25.452
We call it "drama" when we cry,
we’re that simple right?

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:28.685
If it’s funny, it’s comedy.
If it’s sad, it’s drama.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.434
We don’t have enough grasp
on the concept of tragedy.

00:00:33.777 --> 00:00:36.169
Tragedy in the Greek sense.

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:41.130
No, tragedy has
a whole philosophy behind it.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:44.166
Having a tragic flaw,

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:49.011
the larger than life
ambition of the character.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.218
I don’t even think
that there are, you know,

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:57.808
any model of tragedies
that are being played right now

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.023
because I think people
don’t feel the need for it.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:02.820
And probably because

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.866
the horrors outside in reality
are much more horrifying

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:10.773
than what we see on tragedy.

00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:16.315
It’s like if you see Oedipus the King,
oh that’s already been done.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.856
That already happened to our neighbor.

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:24.021
Been there done that.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.470
It’s like what Walter Kauffmann said,

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.021
“Ever since the Holocaust,
who could top that?”

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:34.011
Something like that.

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:39.741
Like Hitler, when the strongmen came in.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.471
It may have its own course in history,

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.825
but for the Philippines,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:00.030
in Philippine context,
those kinds of plays are a category, right?

00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:01.924
Is it comedy or drama?

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:05.205
This is also what determines
the audience, right?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.416
What do Filipinos want?

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.668
Do they want to laugh?
Do they want to cry?

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:14.270
What are they feeling?

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:18.601
Again, it will depend on
what I was saying before

00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:21.701
one, on how you view the situation.

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:31.161
One of the best satirists
I know is Dario Fo.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.921
Do you know him?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:38.488
You need to know him
if you’re interested in satire.

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:42.951
He employed the
commedia dell’arte.

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:44.275
He’s Italian.
F-o.

00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:45.720
D- Dario.

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:47.738
A male Daria.

00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:58.730
He’s into political satire.

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:03.505
Poking fun at the Italian government,
The Vatican, and so on.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.150
There’s a play of his
that I really want to do.

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:09.339
"The Pope and the Witch"

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:12.258
Do you know that?

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.059
It’s a wonderful play.

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.197
There’s a witch.

00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:22.755
Yes, because it’s about the Pope

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:30.029
using Totus Tuus during the mass
then his back suddenly hurt.

00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:33.002
He really couldn’t move.

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:37.775
It became a huge problem in Vatican,

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:40.006
that he was like that.

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.988
Who would be able to treat him?

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.065
Until they realized

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.600
that there’s a woman
in Rome who could help,

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:50.580
and her work is--

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:55.516
but her work involves--
she has an NGO that provides

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:58.712
clean needles for drug addicts,

00:03:58.797 --> 00:04:01.104
and she’s also...

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:06.676
going to use something
prohibited by the catholic church.

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.915
And so they had to...

00:04:11.537 --> 00:04:18.188
secretly make her heal the Pope

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:22.694
because they perceived her
as someone concocting questionable things.

00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:27.935
It’s really funny.
At the same time, in fact,

00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:32.236
it’s one of his less acclaimed works here.

00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:34.530
Here, it seems really obvious.

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:40.798
But his works are indeed
very funny, right?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.816
I mean for him to tackle

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:47.720
a very serious issue

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:55.793
and put it in a funny light requires
a particular skill in framing the situation.

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.403
That’s really comedy.

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:01.434
That's what we're talking about.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:08.448
There are some
who employ a dramatic style.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:19.431
I guess there were more playwrights
who tackled this in the past.

00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:26.576
Is there a Filipino playwright
who only focuses on comedy?

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.346
None, right?

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:31.768
I don't know--
I may be wrong,

00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:35.203
but it’s more tensile to write

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:38.146
because we’re serious,
we take things seriously.

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:40.818
We don’t go against the grain.

00:05:40.843 --> 00:05:46.168
Although, Al Santos’ plays
are also comedic in a way

00:05:46.193 --> 00:05:49.126
and there are some plays
of Rene that are funny,

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:53.198
but mostly they are...

00:05:55.017 --> 00:05:57.025
the mode is drama.

00:05:57.324 --> 00:05:59.138
When I say drama,
not exaggerated drama,

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:05.362
but the mood you feel
is just serious.

00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:13.561
These are different things
that you can take into consideration

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:19.129
because just like what I said,
this will dictate how you see the set

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:24.800
and how you hear the music.

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:27.039
- It could also be
a drama that’s funny?

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:29.578
Yeah.

00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:30.818
- Will it be comedy?

00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:35.385
I don’t know if that’s
the meaning of tragicomedy,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.455
but that’s one of the things
I want to achieve all the time.

00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.788
I would like to think
that’s what Chekhov’s plays are.

00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:50.299
It’s not just

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.473
lugubrious

00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:57.207
that the characters
are so ponderous like that.

00:06:57.314 --> 00:06:58.314
Actually,

00:06:58.943 --> 00:07:02.704
most of Chekhov’s plays
are written as comedies.

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:09.621
Didn’t he and Stanislavski fight
because Stanislavski thinks this is drama?

00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:15.365
As for Alexander Payne’s films,

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:17.844
you can’t tell whether 
they're comedy or drama

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:20.227
because you find it funny,
but at the same time

00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:21.734
you find it sad.

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:29.912
It’s good to achieve that.

00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:34.594
James Joyce called this jocoserious,

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:43.093
seeing humor

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:52.255
at the most crucial
dramatic moment of the character.

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:57.695
There’s a movie of Ulysses
that tactically explains the novel

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.564
because the novel is so dense.

00:08:04.162 --> 00:08:05.319
It's like that.

00:08:05.522 --> 00:08:07.974
It's also very...

00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:12.920
At the most philosophical moment,
suddenly, someone farts.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.338
It’s like that in Ulysses.

00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:22.436
One moment, it’s so philosophical,
you think it’s serious, but really

00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:23.861
it's not.

00:08:24.386 --> 00:08:30.329
That’s what he was trying to achieve,
the mundane and the profound.

00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:37.686
- But in doing so,
will it not break, diminish...

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:41.065
what's supposed to...

00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:47.658
- If I’m part of the audience,
I’m so engrossed with this drama already,

00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:52.467
then out of nowhere
there’s suddenly a comedic scene.

00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:57.033
- Wouldn’t it ruin the mood?

00:08:57.116 --> 00:09:03.516
You know that it’s a risk.
It really depends.

00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:09.161
Watch Jack Nicholson’s
(character in) “About Schmidt”.

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:15.400
I know someone who couldn’t stop
crying about the film

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.198
while I couldn’t stop laughing.

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:22.130
In fact, Jack Nicholson
won Best Actor for it.

00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:24.472
And his famous speech was,

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:29.594
“Thank you very much for this award,
for this Best Actor - Drama award,

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:32.457
“but all the while I thought
we were doing comedy.”

00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:36.722
He won for drama.

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:39.557
You don’t know
if it’s an insult or what.

00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:42.605
Didn’t they understand it?
But they gave him an award.

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:48.586
It’s a great goal in writing.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:53.400
In fact, I always try to achieve that.

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:57.681
But of course, 
you’re not always successful

00:09:57.706 --> 00:10:01.206
as with any other
endeavour in your lives.

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:18.648
- Until now, is it still how we see it
or how you saw it before

00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:21.281
because aren’t comedy
and tragedy separated

00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:25.226
depending on
the outcome of the character?

00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:27.814
- If it’s comedy, I’m not sure,

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:30.867
but they were able to meet
their objective, he got it.

00:10:30.892 --> 00:10:32.887
- While tragedy is the failure to do so.

00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:33.977
- Is it still like that?

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:35.395
What do I think?

00:10:35.442 --> 00:10:40.053
- Yes, or is that what’s strictly right?

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:42.155
- Apparently, it’s changing a bit now.

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:47.001
- Will it just be comedy or just drama,
or how you mix between the lines?

00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:48.588
Yes, I mean--

00:10:48.613 --> 00:10:52.265
It’s still the same.
The definition is a fair guess.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:57.381
But since you know the definition,
you try to break free from it.

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:59.879
When I made the adaptation--

00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:02.568
no, not adaptation,
well, it's an adaptation in a way...

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:06.961
the rendition of “Merchant of Venice”
for Tanghalang Pilipino,

00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:08.203
based from Kauffman,

00:11:09.296 --> 00:11:12.539
I set it during the Holocaust.

00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:15.633
That play is a comedy.

00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:19.860
All the lovers ended up
together and so on.

00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:24.802
But I focused on Antonio,

00:11:25.282 --> 00:11:30.941
a homosexual,
and Shylock, a Jew.

00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:35.390
The Nazis really hated
those two.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.314
And so the whole context of the play

00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:42.974
is that they are prisoners
who are made to play the roles.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.094
So that in the end,

00:11:45.258 --> 00:11:47.281
the Nazi characters

00:11:48.254 --> 00:11:49.602
are happy.

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:51.038
And then in the end,

00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:52.281
you see

00:11:52.734 --> 00:11:57.214
the Jew and the homosexual
being cast in the gas chamber.

00:11:57.712 --> 00:12:00.917
So your take is different.
It’s not comedy anymore

00:12:01.434 --> 00:12:05.997
because a larger context
has somehow taken over.

00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:12.211
It really depends on how

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.656
you’ll angle your camera, your lens.

00:12:18.787 --> 00:12:20.843
Do you see something here?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.046
Like what Brecht is saying,
his dictum in writing.

00:12:25.272 --> 00:12:30.396
"When the character laughs,
the audience cries,"

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:33.474
"and when the character cries,
the audience laughs."

00:12:33.922 --> 00:12:38.372
All of those are matters of style
and matters of taste.

00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:40.177
It may or may not work.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.585
You can choose different things.

00:12:47.287 --> 00:12:50.148
And because of that,
if you start from there,

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:57.917
even the characters
that will suit the genre you chose,

00:12:58.078 --> 00:12:59.765
more or less,

00:13:00.632 --> 00:13:03.378
you can’t put
random characters

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.870
or it’ll become inappropriate.

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:10.893
This is where you gauge
if you’ll start there.

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:13.539
But if for example,
you started with

00:13:15.224 --> 00:13:17.501
a fascination
on the character’s story,

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:23.260
sometimes the character’s life
or the behavior he exhibits,

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:25.854
sometimes it gives you

00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:28.542
a hint or clue

00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:31.968
that this seems like
the appropriate genre for it.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.802
This seems suitable for a musical,

00:13:35.127 --> 00:13:40.685
or this seems like it’s better
as a straight play, or for a one-act play.

00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:47.824
It’s how you combine
the different elements and categories

00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:50.897
that's what creates

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:56.820
 the identity and uniqueness of the play.

00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:03.307
Let’s say, for example, 
you chose the category

00:14:03.525 --> 00:14:07.221
of traditional theater.

00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:12.357
If it’s a passion play, inevitably,
it’s going to be about Jesus Christ.

00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:14.560
It can’t be anyone else, right?

00:14:17.205 --> 00:14:18.413
From there,

00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:27.549
no one else can play the role
but Jesus Christ.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.502
But if you have
a modern interpretation,

00:14:31.575 --> 00:14:33.994
then you can portray Jesus

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.738
as a worker

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:36.996
in the present time

00:14:37.027 --> 00:14:39.644
or as a farmer
whose land is being exploited,

00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:41.878
who's fighting by himself

00:14:42.005 --> 00:14:45.183
while being laughed at by the military.

00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:48.438
That’s what you can do.

00:14:48.819 --> 00:14:53.431
That’s the possibility
of the genre you chose.

00:14:55.441 --> 00:15:00.759
Again, it’s not restricted
to musicals or straight plays only.

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:04.048
You can use rap
or spoken word on your work.

00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:09.639
That’s the style of some writers.

00:15:10.231 --> 00:15:12.556
From there, you can already see

00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:18.533
the way characters talk and its effect.

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:24.135
Especially if the musical
is sung all throughout,

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.229
it means all the lines are sung.

00:15:27.096 --> 00:15:28.526
And so therefore,

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:33.387
you can mix that,
especially in an urban setting.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.911
As opposed to

00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:40.814
rural or even outside the country.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:43.313
Maybe OFWs doing a musical.

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:49.350
How will you mix this?

00:15:51.474 --> 00:15:54.511
And what are the elements

00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:59.340
you’ll include while
balancing it all?

00:15:59.946 --> 00:16:08.686
That’s the challenging part as a writer.

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:13.742
Because sometimes we tend
to get too fascinated with a genre

00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:17.298
so we end up forgetting
what we wanted to say,

00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:23.210
just so our characters
seem impressive.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.929
That’s where you’ll see
the skill of the playwright

00:16:30.026 --> 00:16:33.591
in choosing their genre.
