00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:14.032
I must say

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.056
in the field of cinema,

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:25.846
films are more inclined
as a whole towards realism,

00:00:26.037 --> 00:00:28.156
in the logic behind realism.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:33.017
So much so that even if there’s
magical quality or fantastical quality,

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:37.638
the logic of how they think
or how characters respond

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:42.341
are still in a realistic form of logic.

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:48.501
It doesn’t deviate from that logic.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:52.091
Even if it’s Harry Potter or what,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.724
that world

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:01.995
follows a ‘cause and effect’ rule.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.642
And that cause and effect

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.004
is highlighted
in the whole history of drama

00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:17.299
and the whole history of narrative.

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:27.702
The supreme standing
of cause and effect is important.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.318
The illusion that realism creates
is the breaking of the fourth wall.

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:42.222
And the moment we sit there,
the wall breaks and we see them.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.651
And whatever we see
from beginning ‘til the end,

00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:46.478
that’s it.

00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:48.040
It’s not reality,

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:50.092
but it’s the truth.

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:53.073
Of course, this also developed
and had different branches.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.574
There’s magic realism.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:58.285
There’s also hyperrealism,

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:02.316
where you become part
of the environment

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:07.717
as if you’re not just an audience,
but participants of what’s happening.

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:11.134
Most of the time,
it creates confusion

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.802
to the writer and to the audience
when they say it’s realistic.

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:19.600
They confuse it with reality.

00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:24.394
But reality and realism
are two completely different things.

00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:26.030
Right?

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.209
Reality has no...

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:33.214
Reality doesn’t have the same order

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:37.797
that a realistic work would have.

00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:42.858
Because when you say realistic
you’re really just saying, "It’s alike.”

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.725
You’re creating an illusion
that this is real.

00:02:46.942 --> 00:02:48.498
Most of the time, just like--

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:52.952
especially when it’s
based on a real life event,

00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:55.061
we use those kinds of words.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.764
“Based on real life event.”

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:02.256
The tendency of the beginning writer
is to include the clutter,

00:03:02.288 --> 00:03:05.107
the disorganized condition

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.490
and irrelevant aspects
of the story

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:13.103
 in their work.

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:16.358
So what happens sometimes is
the story gets jumbled

00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:23.192
or you don’t understand
the point of the work.

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:28.894
I think that’s one of the clashes

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.589
you might encounter as a writer.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:40.641
Because when you write
a realistic form of play,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.782
you also have to select
what you need to put.

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:49.344
In the history of world theater,
especially modern theater,

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:52.714
realism also became a constraint.

00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:56.865
Having unity of time,
space, and action

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:59.988
became constricting as well,

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:03.106
that’s why expressionistic
styles were born.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.516
It manifested in visual arts
where we had abstract painting

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:13.694
and figures with huge heads,
three eyes.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.414
Van Gogh’s works started there.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.589
It was really a burst of colors.

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:32.131
It was more on expressing
the inner non-palpable ideas

00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:35.769
on the canvas.

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:39.480
That’s also what happened
to theater, right?

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.547
The most well-known figure
in that field would be Bertolt Brecht,

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.714
who used multimedia, right?

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:55.279
Such as film clippings
and breaking the fourth wall,

00:04:56.912 --> 00:04:59.140
actors talking
in front of the audience.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:04.700
Or even actors telling the story
even before they are dramatized

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:14.212
and taking away the illusion
that what you’re seeing is real.

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:16.123
Something like that.

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:19.968
Of course, the realistic mode
didn’t disappear.

00:05:22.108 --> 00:05:26.640
In theater, I think the reason
why we use the devices we use

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.709
is because some of them
might not translate well to cinema

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:38.400
the founding premise
or expectation

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:43.624
of the film audience
or filmmakers is in realistic mode.

00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:49.262
The logic they employ
would be in that mode.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:53.885
So that’s another category,
it’s neither traditional nor modern,

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:58.645
but what you choose to write.

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:06.094
There’s a type or style
or genre of play

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.424
that destroys
that kind of logic,

00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:12.825
that when things
have already happened,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.635
it doesn’t necessarily mean
it will happen again.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.155
Because the play’s focus
is something different.

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:24.223
I won’t elaborate on this further
because it’s a long discourse

00:06:24.248 --> 00:06:28.350
of having another survey
of different forms.

00:06:31.298 --> 00:06:35.356
To clarify,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.936
let’s separate realist logic
and the non-realist forms.

00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:44.764
And there’s a lot of those
like surrealism, like the absurd,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.405
there’s the expressionist,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.620
there's Brechtian, 
and many more.

00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:55.861
These are also sources

00:06:55.886 --> 00:07:00.937
and there are some Filipino playwrights
who were influenced by these forms.

00:07:03.077 --> 00:07:06.158
Like me, I got influenced
when I was a kid.

00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:13.031
It was my first time to watch a play,
the style used was absurd.

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.414
It was written by Reijoo dela Cruz.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.433
He was from UP Samaskom
and I watched “Programang Putol Putol.”

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:24.378
I thought all plays were like that.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.944
So the first play I wrote, “Recess,”
was based on that kind of structure and style

00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:38.655
where there’s no realist logic.

00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:43.902
At an instant,
the scenes could change

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:46.477
and the topic
could change abruptly.

00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:50.522
But when you combine the stories
and when you finish the play,

00:07:50.876 --> 00:07:53.725
you’ll feel a huge impact.

00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:56.634
When I watched
“Programang Putol Putol,”

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:01.510
I was able to keep track
of the main character’s life,

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:03.877
but my takeaway was

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:06.405
“So this is what mass media is.”

00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:08.072
It’s totally different, right?

00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:10.931
He only used that character

00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:15.444
in order to get in and out
of the hypocrisy of mass media,

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:23.201
of the illusions we see and watch
on television shows, and so on.

00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:26.272
In fact, even at Virgin Labfest
and at other places,

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:33.074
I get excited when there are
other modes that emerge

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:36.479
or when that kind of mode is broken.

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:39.779
Because it demands

00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:44.326
a change of language choice.

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:46.945
It demands a change of setting,

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.498
a change of perspective.

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:52.968
For example, “Daddy’s Girl.”

00:08:53.186 --> 00:09:02.272
Even if it tackles sensitive topics,

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:04.961
it was done differently.

00:09:05.373 --> 00:09:10.269
The issue was framed differently.

00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:15.064
It was talking about
reincarnation, incest,

00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:22.382
so many other things that you
couldn’t put in the logic of realism.

00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:30.184
Also, when you choose
or when you decide to choose

00:09:30.707 --> 00:09:33.050
a non-realistic form,

00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:37.854
it demands of you to also
change your structure.

00:09:38.676 --> 00:09:41.467
It doesn't necessarily need
to be chronological.

00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:48.075
You can juxtapose the past,
present, and so on.

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:52.965
At the same time,

00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:56.129
in the writing level,
if the goal is realistic

00:09:56.218 --> 00:09:59.395
it can still be changed
during the production.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:04.759
A very good example of this
is Rene Villanueva's "Kalantiaw".

00:10:05.017 --> 00:10:12.898
I don't know if you've seen it
because it was in the early 90's.

00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:21.281
He wrote this play about Jose Marco
and how he falsely declared

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:23.957
that we had a Kalantiaw Code,

00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:29.130
how he falsified history

00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:35.716
saying Kalantiaw Code exists,
and we had a Srivijaya Empire, and so on

00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:38.394
just to show that--

00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.871
It's the same material
with Floy Quintos' "Fake",

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:48.550
which shows them
making up historical sources

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:52.995
wherein the Philippines
already had a kingdom

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.638
before the Spaniards came.

00:10:55.103 --> 00:10:58.931
Probably to bolster
our nationalistic pride,

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:03.244
our patriotic pride
that we've been civilized even before.

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:07.090
It was their style,
but they were all invented.

00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:13.591
When Rene Villanueva wrote the play,
he thought of it in realistic mode.

00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:16.716
But the director was French.

00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:21.429
If you've seen it,
its like watching "Waiting for Godot"

00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:26.662
Their actors are there at the side
listening and watching,

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:29.021
and then when it's their cue
that's the only time they enter the stage.

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:33.376
And then the acting
is like watching a circus.

00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:44.300
I actually asked Rene about that,
"How was it? Did you like it?"

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:45.824
"Yes..."

00:11:47.238 --> 00:11:49.967
That feeling of what else could he do?

00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:53.572
He's not the director.

00:11:57.814 --> 00:12:04.808
For some I guess, for that rare occasion,
the transformation worked,

00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:11.660
it actually became
a lot more interesting as a production.
