WEBVTT

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.916
Stand still. Eyes to the floor.

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:47.583
Walk on.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.749
TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.374
MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.124
Address him as Captain.

00:00:56.584 --> 00:00:57.624
Enter.

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:01.874
Sit down.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.374
Hands under your thighs, palms down.

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:15.958
What do you have to tell us?

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.249
I've done nothing.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.583
I know nothing.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.791
You've done nothing, know nothing...

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:29.333
You think we imprison people on a whim?

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:30.916
No...

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.999
If you think our humanistic system
capable of such a thing,

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:36.666
that alone would justify your arrest.

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:43.083
We'd like to jog your memory,
prisoner number 227.

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:48.708
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens,
your friend and neighbor,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.708
fled to the West.
We believe that he had help.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:57.124
I know nothing.
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.416
I first heard about it at work.

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:04.374
Please recount
what you did on September 28th.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.083
-It's in my statement.
-Tell me again.

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:12.999
I was at Treptow Park Memorial
with my children.

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:15.999
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:20.083
We went to his place
and listened to music until late.

00:02:21.084 --> 00:02:24.083
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:27.291
I can give you the number.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.999
The enemies of our state are arrogant.
Remember that.

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:35.166
It takes patience. About 40 hours' worth.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.041
STASI COLLEGE, POTSDAM-EICHE

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:38.374
Fast forward...

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.166
I want to sleep.

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:46.124
Please, let me sleep!

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.583
Hands under your thighs.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.666
Tell me again
what you did on September 28th.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.999
Please, just one hour...

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:02.499
Just a little... A little sleep.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.583
Tell me again what you did on that day.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.208
Why keep him awake for so long?

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.916
It's inhuman.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.833
An innocent prisoner
will become more angry by the hour

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.791
due to the injustice suffered.
He will shout and rage.

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:36.249
A guilty prisoner
becomes more calm and quiet...

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:38.749
Or he cries.

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.458
He knows he's there for a reason.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.833
The best way to establish guilt or innocence

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.124
is non-stop interrogation.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.208
...school friend Max Kirchner.

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.666
We went to his place

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.791
and listened to music until late.

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:05.958
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:11.083
Do you notice anything
about his statement?

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:14.416
It's the same as at the beginning.

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:17.666
Exactly the same. Word for word.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:22.416
People who tell the truth
can re-formulate things, and they do.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.583
A liar has prepared sentences

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.083
which he falls back on
when under pressure.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.791
227 is lying.
We have two important indicators

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.624
and can increase the intensity.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:42.874
If you don't give names,
we'll have to arrest your wife.

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:48.249
Jan and Nadja will be put into state care.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.499
Is that what you want?

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:58.708
Who was the person who helped him flee?

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.541
-Gläske...
-Again! Speak clearly!

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.416
-Gläske... Werner Gläske.
-Werner...

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:11.458
...Gläske.

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:18.749
Quiet!

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:20.458
Listen!

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.666
Does anyone know what that is?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.374
It's the odor sample for the dogs.

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:41.791
It must be collected at every interrogation.
Never forget it!

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.124
Your subjects are enemies of socialism.

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:52.833
Never forget that!

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.416
Good-bye.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.166
That was good, really good.

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:06.583
You remember

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.583
how we sat there 20 years ago?

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:15.583
They've offered me a professorship.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.499
Life's not about good grades, though
mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:24.749
So what's up?

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.958
Why do you always think I'm scheming?

00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:31.458
-I wanted to invite you to the theater.
-The theater?

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:34.916
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:39.041
As head of the Culture Department,
I should show my face.

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:43.041
It starts at 7:00 p.m. We should get going.

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:48.541
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.916
Minister Hempf at 1:00.

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:04.249
He used to be in State Security, you know.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:07.249
He really cleaned up the theater scene.

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.374
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:22.749
An arrogant type,
the kind I warn my students about.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.374
But he's loyal. If they were all like him,

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:30.249
I'd be out of a job.
He's our only non-subversive writer

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.499
who is also read in the West.

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:35.541
He thinks the GDR is
the greatest country on earth.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.958
See for yourself.

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.833
-What's wrong, my child? A new vision?
-Speak, Marta!

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.916
-Speak!
-Your Arthur...

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.416
-Is dead.
-Arthur?

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.583
Can't you be wrong, just this once?

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:10.541
No, sister. Believe me.

00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:14.958
He fell to his death.

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:20.416
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:23.749
I see it,

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.458
though I'd rather see any other horror.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.083
Why am I not spared these visions?

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:38.916
Elena!

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:41.541
Go home

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.416
and mourn. I'll finish your shift.

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:24.624
Did you like it?

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:28.999
-Dreyman's good, huh?
-I'd have him monitored.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.291
Monitored?
All that teaching is ruining your instincts.

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:37.583
-I could oversee it myself.
-He's clean, I tell you.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:41.499
Even Hempf likes him.
We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.

00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:43.624
I'm going down.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.416
FACES OF LOVE

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:16.291
I hear a lot about your work.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.583
They say culture's in good hands.
Your name is mentioned

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:24.041
-in Party circles.
-We're the Party's "shield and sword."

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.333
I'm aware of that at all times.

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:33.083
What do you make of him?

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.583
Of Georg Dreyman?

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:42.958
Maybe...

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:45.999
Maybe what?

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:52.499
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.

00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.458
Grubitz!

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:59.166
That's why you and I are on top.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.083
Your average Stasi chump would have said,

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:07.124
"One of our best! So loyal!" etc.
But we can see more.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.833
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.

00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:17.333
There's something fishy about him.
I can feel it in my gut.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:25.124
Dreyman's having a party next week.

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:26.833
Some dubious types are going...

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:31.916
Hauser and that rabble.
Try to wire the place discreetly by then.

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:34.958
Measures A and B. Only in his rooms.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:37.958
Nothing conspicuous.
He has powerful friends.

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.541
No one is to know about this

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:43.749
until we've found something.

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:49.249
But if you get something on him,

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.124
you'll have a good friend
in the Central Committee.

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:54.791
You understand what I'm saying?

00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:59.916
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:23.458
Why is he staring at us?

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.874
What's he doing here, anyway?

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:32.374
I think he's got a crush on you.

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:50.416
I can't let the evening pass

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:55.749
without raising a toast to our artists.
A great Socialist,

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:58.041
I can't recall who it was, once said,

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.333
"Writers are engineers of the soul."

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.583
So Georg Dreyman is
one of our country's greatest engineers.

00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:12.624
-What charming bedfellows you have.
-Paul!

00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:17.583
And to Christa-Maria Sieland,

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:22.083
the loveliest pearl of the GDR.

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:26.249
Let's raise our glasses
to Christa-Maria Sieland.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:29.583
Three cheers to her.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:36.541
Someone like him doesn't
even deserve to address you.

00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:37.791
Stay with me!

00:13:41.084 --> 00:13:43.166
And now something for the soul...

00:13:44.584 --> 00:13:45.624
May I?

00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:54.249
-How did you like my speech?
-Many thanks.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.291
I liked your play, too.

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:01.083
-Really, it was good.
-"Engineers of the soul."

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:04.166
-That was a Stalin quote.
-Really?

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:08.833
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.999
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.

00:14:14.084 --> 00:14:16.416
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:21.416
He knows that the Party needs artists,
but that artists need the Party even more.

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:25.041
If you're going to talk politics,
I'll find another dance partner.

00:14:25.084 --> 00:14:27.083
-I'm willing.
-Too late!

00:14:32.584 --> 00:14:37.916
-I follow our theater with interest.
-It used to be theater people...

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:38.999
Paul!

00:14:39.084 --> 00:14:42.916
It's okay, I've known Mr. Hauser for years.
Comrade Schwalber!

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:46.083
You did a good job tonight, too.

00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:52.124
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working
with such directors. It wasn't always so.

00:14:54.084 --> 00:14:55.833
You're referring to Jerska?

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.499
I think you judged him too harshly.

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.583
Sure, he went too far in what he said.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.249
Without a doubt.

00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:10.749
But put yourself in his shoes for a moment.

00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:13.208
You, as a man of honor.

00:15:14.084 --> 00:15:16.624
He can't remove his name
from that statement.

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:24.874
He could work for any theater in the West.
But he wants to stay here.

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:28.833
Because he believes in socialism
and in this country.

00:15:30.334 --> 00:15:32.833
-His blacklisting is...
-Blacklisting?

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.833
We don't do that here!

00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:39.499
You should choose your words
more carefully.

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:47.124
Comrade Hempf, just between us,

00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:52.791
my plays are not strong enough
to survive Schwalber's direction.

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:57.333
I need Jerska,
and I think you judged him too harshly.

00:15:57.417 --> 00:16:01.666
Well, I don't.
But that's what we all love about your plays.

00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:04.041
Your love for mankind,

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.541
your belief that people can change.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:11.958
Dreyman, no matter how often
you say it in your plays,

00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:14.791
people do not change!

00:16:18.709 --> 00:16:20.249
How is he, by the way?

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:23.458
He hopes that his black...

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.416
That he can work again soon.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.249
-Is he right in hoping?
-Of course he is.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:38.999
As long as he lives, and even longer.

00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:42.874
Because as you know, Dreyman,
hope always dies last.

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:01.833
The team will be ready
to wire the place as of tomorrow.

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:05.958
It needs to be finished by Thursday.

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.166
Think you can do it?

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:12.999
Good night.

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:16.291
...and land for chicken farmers,

00:18:16.875 --> 00:18:19.041
but used in an efficient way...

00:18:21.084 --> 00:18:24.874
The 10th Party Conference
economic policy is solid.

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:27.208
Now more than ever, the...

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.583
-I'll get in trouble if I don't go.
-With who?

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:50.874
My girlfriend.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.583
Girlfriend?

00:18:53.084 --> 00:18:55.458
-All right, then.
-Come on, let's play!

00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:49.291
Twenty minutes.

00:22:47.209 --> 00:22:48.791
-Yes?
-Frau Meineke,

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:53.791
one word of this to anyone,
and Masha loses her spot at the university.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.874
-Is that understood?
-Yes.

00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:07.999
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift
for her cooperation.

00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:22.583
It must be Thursday again.

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:27.374
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:47.874
-How are you?
-Not bad.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.999
It's not always this noisy.

00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:54.541
Only on Thursdays, I know.

00:23:55.542 --> 00:23:56.583
Yes.

00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:02.874
We missed you at the premiere.

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:05.208
Did Schwalber do a good job?

00:24:08.084 --> 00:24:12.083
-His good bits were stolen from you.
-That keeps my ideas alive.

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:26.416
I can't bear those fat,
dressed-up people at premieres anymore.

00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:32.208
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:38.083
But maybe this is the real me,
not the old Jerska.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.333
He was friendly and caring,
nourished by success,

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.416
all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.

00:24:52.542 --> 00:24:54.541
But I won't complain much longer.

00:24:55.084 --> 00:24:59.708
In my next life, I'll simply be an author.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.833
A happy author
who can write whenever he wants.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.249
Like you.

00:25:07.125 --> 00:25:09.416
What is a director if he can't direct?

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.749
He's a projectionist without a film,

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:16.041
a miller without corn. He is nothing.

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:22.916
Nothing at all.

00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:31.374
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere.
Minister Hempf.

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.916
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.

00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:42.249
It looks promising.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:48.124
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.

00:25:50.792 --> 00:25:51.833
Really?

00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:57.333
That's great.

00:26:41.084 --> 00:26:43.374
Cheap Georgian wine. Château Jerska.

00:26:43.917 --> 00:26:45.958
So is our holy drinker coming?

00:26:49.917 --> 00:26:51.416
I forgot to ask him.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:00.166
You're strong and forceful.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.291
That's how I need you.
Don't let this blackness into your life.

00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:05.916
Albert is my friend.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.333
-And you're my boyfriend.
-Look's like a 50th.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:12.749
But I'm going to be 40, right?

00:27:13.375 --> 00:27:17.499
Don't forget,
you promised to wear a tie for your birthday.

00:27:18.084 --> 00:27:19.958
I would, but I don't have one.

00:27:24.584 --> 00:27:25.916
Bon anniversaire!

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.916
A tie?

00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:33.083
You said you didn't want any books.

00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:38.749
Or can't you tie a tie,
you old working-class poet?

00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:43.333
What? I was born wearing a tie!

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.541
I had to "fight my way out
of my middle-class fetters."

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.583
Then put those fetters on again, just for me.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.416
All right...

00:28:02.917 --> 00:28:06.166
It's no big deal to tie a tie.

00:28:22.542 --> 00:28:25.916
Frau Meineke,
would you come in for a moment!

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.374
Can you tie a tie?

00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:43.916
You've no idea how thankful I am.

00:28:49.584 --> 00:28:51.208
Are you feeling unwell?

00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:54.083
No... I'm feeling fine.

00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:56.333
Finished?

00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:04.208
Wonderful. It's perfect. It couldn't be better.

00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:09.666
It'll be our secret.
You can keep a secret, right?

00:29:10.584 --> 00:29:11.666
Of course.

00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:23.583
I'll be damned!

00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:26.374
And I thought you couldn't do it.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.916
You don't normally hide your talents.

00:29:29.584 --> 00:29:31.541
You've no idea of the things I can do!

00:29:37.084 --> 00:29:38.166
The first guest.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.916
Our dear neighbors locked
the main door again. Can you go?

00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:49.458
Yes, I'm going.

00:30:15.792 --> 00:30:18.291
Maestro! Our humble offerings.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:21.874
I expressly said no books! But thanks.

00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:23.333
Have a look first.

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.583
-Would you like a drink?
-A soda.

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:29.708
-Vodka for me.
-I'll get it.

00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:44.749
-Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?
-He won't talk to us.

00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:46.291
He sent us all away.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.791
I brought you something, too.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.749
Did you really come here to read?

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:11.166
It is Brecht!

00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:22.791
I feel like a fraud among these people.

00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:26.583
A fraud? Come off it, Albert!

00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:29.749
You're losing your grip on reality.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.958
You know how we admire you,
how everybody admires you.

00:31:35.417 --> 00:31:37.874
For something I did 1 0 years ago

00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:43.291
and could probably never do again.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.833
My favorite director! Wait!

00:31:50.042 --> 00:31:52.208
I need to talk to you a moment.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.749
Tell me again
how you got into this position.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.916
Pure talent.

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:00.208
Of course!

00:32:01.042 --> 00:32:03.583
But what else did you have to do?

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.041
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!

00:32:07.209 --> 00:32:09.499
What an outrageous insinuation!

00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:11.083
-Paul!
-What?

00:32:12.417 --> 00:32:14.958
Excuse my friend,
he's had too much to drink.

00:32:18.084 --> 00:32:21.999
-But you know he's with the Stasi!
-No, Paul.

00:32:22.584 --> 00:32:23.999
I don't know that.

00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:46.291
You're such an idealist
that you're almost a bigwig.

00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:51.416
It was informers and conformists
like that who ruined Albert.

00:32:52.292 --> 00:32:54.999
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!

00:32:56.084 --> 00:32:58.749
If you ever want to take action, call.

00:32:59.292 --> 00:33:01.416
If not, we don't have to meet again.

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:35.416
-Your friends don't have much taste.
-That's really unfair.

00:33:36.084 --> 00:33:37.083
Here!

00:33:37.417 --> 00:33:41.874
-Look at this beautiful backscratcher.
-That's a salad fork!

00:33:43.584 --> 00:33:45.708
Still, it's beautiful...

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:49.458
And look at this.

00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:54.208
-I'll write my new play with this.
-You have no taste either!

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:57.791
I do in some things.

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:14.499
It's from Jerska.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.249
So he did give you a book!

00:34:22.542 --> 00:34:25.333
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN

00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:52.124
11:04 p.m.
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents.

00:34:52.209 --> 00:34:57.499
Then presumably have intercourse.

00:35:00.334 --> 00:35:01.458
You're late.

00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:07.458
Sorry, Captain. Those red lights made me
lose all of four minutes.

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:09.583
You know how it is.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.291
They're already at it! Unbelievable!

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.624
These artists! They're always at it!

00:35:25.584 --> 00:35:30.083
That's why I prefer monitoring artists
to priests or peace activists.

00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:35.583
See you tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:45.666
Albert Jerska, Operation "Engerling."

00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:50.458
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.
The files will be sent. Let's have lunch.

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:05.583
The BSG volleyball team will
meet at 7:00 p.m.

00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:09.208
Did you forget? Bosses sit over there.

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.874
Socialism must start somewhere.

00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:23.916
About the license plate of the car
that brought Ms. Sieland home...

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.749
It's Minister Hempf's car.

00:36:32.125 --> 00:36:35.249
Wiesler, we can't monitor top officials.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:42.333
I removed the entry in your report.
Nothing written from now on, just oral!

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.874
So we're helping a Committee member
get a rival out of the way.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:57.249
You know what this could mean
for my career. And for yours.

00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.749
If we find something...

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:08.249
Is that why we joined?

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.416
You remember the oath we took?

00:37:12.042 --> 00:37:16.083
-"We are the Party's shield and sword."
-What is the Party, if not its members?

00:37:17.334 --> 00:37:20.583
And if those members are highly influential,
all the better!

00:37:21.334 --> 00:37:22.749
I've got a new one.

00:37:23.917 --> 00:37:26.624
Honecker comes into his office,

00:37:27.417 --> 00:37:30.333
opens the window, sees the sun, and says...

00:37:31.625 --> 00:37:32.833
What's wrong?

00:37:36.792 --> 00:37:38.708
Oh, excuse me...

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.666
I just...

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.916
No, carry on, colleague!

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.249
No harm in laughing
about the Party Chairman, is there?

00:37:48.167 --> 00:37:50.124
I probably know the joke anyway.

00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:54.583
Come on, tell us!

00:37:56.209 --> 00:37:57.249
Well...

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:01.374
Honecker...
I mean, the Comrade General Secretary

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.666
sees the sun and says,
"Good morning, dear sun!"

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:08.374
More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:17.416
The sun replies, "Good morning,
dear Erich!" And at noon,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.166
Erich goes to the window and says,
"Good day, dear sun!"

00:38:21.584 --> 00:38:27.124
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!"
In the evening, Erich says again,

00:38:27.209 --> 00:38:30.083
"Good evening, dear sun!"
and the sun doesn't reply.

00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:33.083
"Good evening, dear sun..."

00:38:33.792 --> 00:38:35.166
"What's wrong?" he asks.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.666
And the sun replies,
"Screw you, I'm in the West now!"

00:38:45.167 --> 00:38:46.208
Name?

00:38:47.209 --> 00:38:48.541
Rank? Department?

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.541
Me?

00:38:54.334 --> 00:38:55.374
Stigler.

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:58.583
Second Lieutenant Axel Stigler.
Department M.

00:38:59.584 --> 00:39:03.583
I don't have to tell you
what this means for your career.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:11.458
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I was just...

00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:14.166
You were just deriding the Party!

00:39:14.542 --> 00:39:17.749
That's incitement,
and likely just the tip of the iceberg!

00:39:18.959 --> 00:39:21.458
I will report this to the Minister's office.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:36.583
Just kidding! Good one, huh?

00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:39.916
But yours was good, too.
I know a better one, though.

00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:43.999
What's the difference
between Honecker and a phone?

00:39:45.084 --> 00:39:47.166
None at all. Hang up, try again!

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.583
-Are you coming, too?
-No, I have to get home.

00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:34.708
Bye.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.041
Cold?

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.291
Christa,
you forgot our meeting on Thursday.

00:40:51.959 --> 00:40:54.916
Or did your poet
have two birthdays in a row?

00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:58.958
Come on, get in.

00:41:00.042 --> 00:41:01.083
Get in!

00:41:13.542 --> 00:41:15.666
You don't know what's good for you.

00:41:30.542 --> 00:41:31.666
Don't worry.

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.249
I'm looking after you.

00:41:50.792 --> 00:41:52.708
Tell me you don't need it, too.

00:41:54.417 --> 00:41:56.416
Just say so, and I'll let you go.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.958
I'm meeting someone.

00:42:12.084 --> 00:42:13.999
Where do you think we're going?

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.374
I'm taking you to him!

00:42:18.542 --> 00:42:20.374
You'll be there even quicker.

00:43:15.917 --> 00:43:17.874
Time for some bitter truths.

00:43:35.084 --> 00:43:36.083
Yes?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.208
Those idiots!

00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:11.958
Next Thursday at the Metropol.

00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:15.499
Drive!

00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:36.458
Christa?

00:46:38.917 --> 00:46:40.416
Just hold me.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.291
Good evening, Comrade!

00:47:15.334 --> 00:47:17.666
You're five minutes late again.

00:48:01.584 --> 00:48:04.166
Evening. 1 1th floor, right corridor.

00:48:04.917 --> 00:48:06.416
I'm already up here.

00:48:11.584 --> 00:48:13.666
How did you get into the building?

00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:16.249
A bunch of you guys live here.

00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:20.958
I don't think I've been here before.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.583
No, I don't think you have.

00:48:36.417 --> 00:48:38.874
Well? Was that nice?

00:48:47.709 --> 00:48:49.458
Stay awhile.

00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:53.208
I can't, my next customer is at half-past.

00:48:55.709 --> 00:48:57.208
I work on a schedule.

00:49:03.875 --> 00:49:05.083
At 1:30?

00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:10.458
-You won't make it.
-Sure I will. Don't you worry.

00:49:13.084 --> 00:49:14.916
Book me for longer next time.

00:49:16.334 --> 00:49:17.374
Bye.

00:50:23.417 --> 00:50:24.416
Georg?

00:50:25.542 --> 00:50:28.958
-Did you hear about Hauser?
-No, what happened?

00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:32.916
He can't get a travel permit
for his lectures in the West.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.083
Are you surprised?
If he acts so arrogantly, he should expect it.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.124
Would you let him go,
if you were in their position?

00:50:49.834 --> 00:50:53.708
CMS comes home.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:59.999
"Lazlo" approves
of Hauser's foreign travel ban.

00:51:07.084 --> 00:51:09.583
-Have you seen my Brecht book?
-What?

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.499
My Brecht book.

00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:14.583
I don't know where it is.

00:51:16.209 --> 00:51:18.416
Strange. I could've sworn...

00:51:19.792 --> 00:51:21.916
One day in blue-moon September,

00:51:22.584 --> 00:51:24.624
silent under a plum tree,

00:51:25.667 --> 00:51:27.999
I held her, my silent pale love,

00:51:28.709 --> 00:51:31.041
in my arms like a fair and lovely dream.

00:51:32.334 --> 00:51:34.291
Above us in the summer skies

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:36.874
was a cloud that caught my eye.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.499
It was white and so high up.

00:51:41.417 --> 00:51:44.499
And when I looked up,
it was no longer there.

00:52:05.709 --> 00:52:07.499
-Yes?
-Georg? Wallner here.

00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:09.666
What's up?

00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:13.041
Georg, it's about Jerska.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.791
He hanged himself last night.

00:52:24.417 --> 00:52:25.583
Georg?

00:52:28.417 --> 00:52:30.083
I'm going to hang up, okay?

00:54:18.709 --> 00:54:22.083
You know what Lenin said
about Beethoven's Appassionata.

00:54:25.334 --> 00:54:28.583
"If I keep listening to it,
I won't finish the revolution."

00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:35.749
Can anyone who has heard this music,

00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:38.624
I mean truly heard it,

00:54:40.042 --> 00:54:41.624
really be a bad person?

00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:17.833
Are you really with the Stasi?

00:55:23.917 --> 00:55:26.499
Do you even know what the Stasi is?

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.666
Yes. They're bad men who
put people in prison, says my dad.

00:55:33.584 --> 00:55:34.583
I see.

00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:37.083
What's the name of your...

00:55:40.709 --> 00:55:41.916
My what?

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.416
Ball! What's the name of your ball?

00:55:46.875 --> 00:55:49.249
You're funny! Balls don't have names.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.333
It's all in place, Minister.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.708
The latest technology.

00:56:01.542 --> 00:56:04.166
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.

00:56:04.584 --> 00:56:07.499
-Measure C in the hall...
-You said you'd find something!

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.249
Find something!

00:56:10.292 --> 00:56:13.166
I'd advise even my worst enemy
not to disappoint me.

00:56:17.334 --> 00:56:18.791
Now get out of here.

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.833
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.

00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:32.999
You'll report on every minute
that she's not with me.

00:56:35.667 --> 00:56:39.374
We revoked Hauser's travel permit
for the culture conference.

00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:41.541
Maybe that'll lead to something.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.916
The two of them are very close.

00:56:45.459 --> 00:56:47.958
How's it going
between CMS and the Minister?

00:56:48.334 --> 00:56:51.583
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.

00:56:51.792 --> 00:56:53.166
That's good. Very good.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.708
We have a lot to gain from this love story.

00:56:57.584 --> 00:56:58.916
Or a lot to lose.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.083
Don't forget that.

00:57:14.209 --> 00:57:16.499
I used to be afraid of just two things:

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.124
Being alone, and not being able to write.

00:57:22.292 --> 00:57:24.666
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing

00:57:25.667 --> 00:57:27.249
or about other people.

00:57:28.917 --> 00:57:31.083
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.

00:57:32.834 --> 00:57:34.749
You needn't be afraid tonight.

00:57:37.167 --> 00:57:39.916
-I'm just going out for a few hours.
-Where to?

00:57:41.417 --> 00:57:43.624
An old classmate's in town.

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:46.083
Really, Christa?

00:57:48.917 --> 00:57:49.916
Really?

00:57:51.084 --> 00:57:52.291
How dare you.

00:57:55.917 --> 00:57:56.958
I know.

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.249
I know where you're going.

00:58:04.584 --> 00:58:06.374
And I'm asking you not to go.

00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:12.041
You don't need him.

00:58:21.334 --> 00:58:23.333
I know about your medication, too.

00:58:25.417 --> 00:58:27.624
And how little faith you have in your talent.

00:58:29.584 --> 00:58:31.291
Have faith in me, at least.

00:58:33.917 --> 00:58:35.124
Christa-Maria.

00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:38.458
You are a great artist.

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:42.541
I know that.

00:58:43.459 --> 00:58:45.374
And your audience knows it, too.

00:58:46.917 --> 00:58:52.416
You don't need him.

00:58:53.334 --> 00:58:54.416
Stay here.

00:58:56.042 --> 00:58:57.374
Don't go to him.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:02.291
No?

00:59:03.584 --> 00:59:04.916
Don't I need him?

00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.416
Don't I need this whole system?

00:59:12.334 --> 00:59:13.583
What about you?

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.083
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.

00:59:19.667 --> 00:59:23.083
But you get in bed with them, too.
Why do you do it?

00:59:24.417 --> 00:59:29.083
Because they can destroy you, too,
despite your talent and your faith.

00:59:32.209 --> 00:59:34.166
Because they decide what we play,

00:59:34.584 --> 00:59:36.999
who is to act, and who can direct.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.916
You don't want to end up like Jerska.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.083
And neither do I.

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.083
That's why I'm going now.

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.874
You're right about so many things,

00:59:53.834 --> 00:59:55.416
and I want to change so much.

00:59:58.917 --> 01:00:00.249
But I ask you,

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.374
I implore you,

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.166
don't go.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.666
Well, boss, am I on time?

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.458
Let me guess what those two are doing...

01:00:11.417 --> 01:00:14.416
Bang, bang, bang! Come on, I'll take over.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.583
I don't want you
to do overtime because of me.

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:29.791
"Don't go through that door."

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:31.791
Where's she going?

01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:36.708
To meet an old classmate.

01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:45.124
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow.
I can manage.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.583
Good night.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.999
What are you staring at?

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:57.499
Soda water.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.333
No...

01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:03.416
Vodka.

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:05.374
Double.

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:13.541
Another one.

01:02:29.334 --> 01:02:31.124
Can I have a cognac, please?

01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:24.916
Madam?

01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:27.749
Go away, I want to be alone.

01:03:29.084 --> 01:03:30.249
Ms. Sieland.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.583
Do we know each other?

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:36.874
You don't know me, but I know you.

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:41.249
Many people love you

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.249
for who you are.

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:51.208
-Actors are never "who they are."
-You are.

01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:00.374
I've seen you on stage.

01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:05.874
You were more who you are

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:11.499
than you are now.

01:04:16.084 --> 01:04:17.791
So you know what I'm like.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.583
I'm your audience.

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.083
I have to go.

01:04:28.542 --> 01:04:29.541
Where to?

01:04:31.459 --> 01:04:33.791
I'm meeting an old classmate. l...

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:35.833
You see?

01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:38.374
Just now you weren't being yourself.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:41.583
No?

01:04:42.084 --> 01:04:43.124
No.

01:04:56.084 --> 01:04:57.708
So you know her well,

01:04:58.167 --> 01:04:59.916
this Christa-Maria Sieland.

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:04.249
What do you think...

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.124
Would she hurt someone
who loves her above all else?

01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:17.499
-Would she sell herself for art?
-For art?

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.708
You already have art. That'd be a bad deal.

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:24.749
You are a great artist.

01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:28.291
Don't you know that?

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.083
And you are a good man.

01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.749
When I begin my shift,
"Lazlo" and CMS are arguing

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:19.249
about whether CMS should
meet her classmate.

01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:21.583
Eventually, she leaves.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.708
"Lazlo" seems unhappy about this.

01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:29.999
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:32.124
to "Lazlo's" surprise, and mine.

01:06:32.667 --> 01:06:34.624
He seems very happy about this.

01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:36.916
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.

01:06:41.584 --> 01:06:44.041
She says she'll never leave again.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.999
He says repeatedly,

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.791
"Now I'll have the strength,
now I'll do something."

01:06:50.417 --> 01:06:53.916
This likely refers
to writing a new stage play.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.791
In recent weeks, "Lazlo's" playwriting

01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:59.624
had been plagued by difficulties.

01:07:00.084 --> 01:07:02.583
What she means by her statement is unclear.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:06.916
Perhaps she intends to
take better care of his household.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.916
The rest of the night was peaceful.

01:07:10.334 --> 01:07:12.458
Oh, Comrade...

01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:14.666
It's just because...

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:16.749
He's sleeping, too...

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:19.666
Good report.

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:23.916
Really?

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:45.041
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:50.374
Neither did l.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.999
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side."

01:08:00.417 --> 01:08:03.833
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:05.916
counts everything, knows everything.

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:09.208
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:12.208
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:15.833
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year:

01:08:16.209 --> 01:08:18.208
6347.

01:08:19.334 --> 01:08:22.041
But there is one thing they don't count,

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:25.874
maybe because even bureaucrats
find it painful,

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:27.999
and that's suicides.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.208
If you call Beimler Street to ask

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.208
how many people
between the Elbe and the Oder,

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.374
between the Baltic Sea
and the Ore Mountains,

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:37.708
despair drove to their death,

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:42.208
our numbers oracle is silent.
But it may just note your name

01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:44.083
for State Security,

01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:48.083
those gray men
who ensure safety in our land

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.291
and happiness.

01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:55.166
In 1977,
our country stopped counting suicides.

01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:58.666
They called them "self-murderers."

01:08:59.959 --> 01:09:02.791
But it has nothing to do with murder.

01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:06.999
It knows no bloodlust, no heated passion.

01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:11.749
It knows only death, the death of all hope.

01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:15.583
When we stopped counting,

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:19.291
only one country in Europe
drove more people to their death:

01:09:20.084 --> 01:09:21.416
Hungary.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:26.374
We came next,
the land of "Real Existing Socialism."

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:30.499
One of the uncounted is Albert Jerska,
the great director.

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.791
It's him I want to talk about today...

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:40.333
I tried to get statistics that show that...

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:44.583
That State Security operates more
effectively than we think.

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:56.583
I foolishly rehearsed
my speech for the West in here.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.583
Since then, I've become very musical.

01:10:04.084 --> 01:10:05.791
We can meet at my place.

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:16.499
3:00 P.M. PANKOW MEMORIAL

01:10:21.834 --> 01:10:23.541
Well? Is this safe enough?

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:33.416
My own "bodyguard." I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:37.583
Fire away.

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:40.208
Here.

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:52.874
You want to publish this?

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:56.083
In the West, with your help. Will you help?

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:03.708
Have you told Christa?

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:05.749
No.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:11.916
I'll help you,
as long as you don't tell her anything.

01:11:12.459 --> 01:11:15.541
-What?
-Georg, it's for her own protection.

01:11:17.084 --> 01:11:20.833
This could be right for the Spiegel.
I'm friends with an editor there.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.874
Gregor Hessenstein. Know him?

01:11:23.084 --> 01:11:25.458
-Not personally.
-You have to meet him.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.374
But you can't publish using your real name.

01:11:30.792 --> 01:11:35.166
Unless your idea of fun
is a 48-hour interrogation.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.166
I'm cold.

01:11:38.667 --> 01:11:40.333
We could go to my place?

01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:44.083
There's no State Security at my place.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:48.583
A friend of Margot Honecker,
winner of the National Award...

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:52.166
-Second class.
-My apartment is clean, I tell you.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:56.249
If only we could be sure...

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:02.083
I have an idea
how we can check your apartment.

01:12:03.084 --> 01:12:04.916
You know my Uncle Frank

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.583
who visits from West Berlin every Saturday

01:12:07.959 --> 01:12:10.208
with his big gold Mercedes.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:13.749
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:17.208
Yes, I agree with Georg.

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:20.249
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?

01:12:20.459 --> 01:12:22.416
I'm really not sure.

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:24.874
Come on, they won't search under the seats.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.416
They'll look under the axles,
tap the exhaust,

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.208
then I'll be across. Paul, too.

01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:35.333
The border guards aren't very bright.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.541
You've got the wrong idea there.

01:12:39.584 --> 01:12:41.374
Which border will you cross?

01:12:41.584 --> 01:12:44.374
Heinrich-Heine Street.
Always Heinrich-Heine Street.

01:12:45.209 --> 01:12:47.666
They know me and my gold Mercedes.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:50.666
I'm friends with the guards.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:55.833
Trust me, I'll call you in two hours,
a Schultheiss beer in my hand

01:12:56.417 --> 01:12:59.499
and report the news: Paul's across.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:00.708
No!

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:04.916
-What about Paul's Stasi man?
-Rolf.

01:13:05.417 --> 01:13:07.249
Rolfy, Rolfy...

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.583
He'll think that Paul's at home.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.499
Okay, I have to go.

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:15.958
We wouldn't want him to suffocate,
would we?

01:13:16.042 --> 01:13:17.458
It'd be a shame.

01:13:22.417 --> 01:13:24.791
Okay, take care!

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:30.083
Heinrich-Heine Street

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:35.083
Another beer?

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.874
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.

01:13:44.584 --> 01:13:48.499
Who is this?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.041
No reply.

01:13:56.292 --> 01:13:58.166
Just this once, my friend.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:25.583
-Dreyman.
-Okay, Paul's plan worked!

01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:29.333
-No border control at all?
-No.

01:14:29.417 --> 01:14:35.291
No special checks. Those boys aren't
so bad. It worked as planned.

01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:38.374
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:43.041
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.

01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:44.583
Yeah, true.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:47.749
See you soon, and thanks a lot.

01:14:47.834 --> 01:14:48.874
Bye.

01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:01.958
What do we do if they ask
what we're doing together?

01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:09.749
Then... We'll say...

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:15.791
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.916
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:20.916
Yes.

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:23.124
And it's kind of true.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:31.624
Who'd have thought our State Security
was so incompetent?

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.666
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?

01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:44.999
Just you wait...

01:15:55.834 --> 01:15:59.166
7:32 p.m.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:06.249
No further noteworthy incidents.

01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:23.249
Hello, Comrade. Listen to this here.

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:28.708
Sure, in 1967

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:32.916
there were many suicides.
But why in 1 977? You must explain.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.916
You must describe
the social conditions more clearly.

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:40.458
It should remain literature,
not political agitation.

01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:45.624
The text is great. I just want to be
sure people understand it in the West.

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:48.041
It'll cause a sensation either way.

01:16:49.459 --> 01:16:52.499
-That's Hauser.
-Of course it's Hauser.

01:16:53.334 --> 01:16:54.583
He's not in the West.

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.958
They're writing a play together.

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.666
For the 40th anniversary.

01:17:08.584 --> 01:17:11.458
It doesn't sound like a play to me.

01:17:14.584 --> 01:17:16.083
No? Then what?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.833
I don't know, but not a play.

01:17:21.334 --> 01:17:23.916
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.

01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:28.249
-You're not an intellectual, are you?
-Me? No...

01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:31.583
-I'm not one of those.
-Then don't behave like one.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.708
I chose you because you know
the equipment and don't ask questions.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.833
-Leave the thinking to your superiors.
-Yes, Captain.

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:44.499
I'll be off, then.

01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:48.708
Have a nice day of work...

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.249
I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.499
Maybe I can rewrite this part.

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:02.791
I'll send you all the material we have.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.333
Can you do it in two weeks?

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:10.083
Then I could run it as a cover story
for the first week in March.

01:18:13.792 --> 01:18:14.999
It's Christa.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.833
Georg?

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:20.708
Christa,

01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:22.916
this is Gregor Hessenstein.

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:26.833
-Christa Sieland.
-Of course, I know that.

01:18:27.459 --> 01:18:29.749
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?

01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:32.708
Hauser and I are writing a play

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.874
-for the GDR's 40th anniversary.
-Together?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.249
The Spiegel may do an article on it.

01:18:39.334 --> 01:18:42.083
-And who'll play the lead role?
-We planned to ask you.

01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:46.208
Christa, who would you rather play:
Lenin or his dear old mother?

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:47.916
You can choose.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:52.333
I see I'm not welcome here. I'll go for a nap.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.208
Your caution is praiseworthy.

01:19:04.125 --> 01:19:08.499
The fewer people know, the better.
The Stasi is not to be toyed with.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.833
On that note, I brought something for you.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.624
I'd have preferred the whole pie.
I already have a typewriter.

01:19:26.084 --> 01:19:28.624
The Stasi can identify its typeface.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:34.249
If they intercepted the text at the border,
you'd end up in Hohenschönhausen.

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:38.666
And that's no fun,
as Paul can confirm, right?

01:19:40.459 --> 01:19:44.624
I'm afraid I could only get
a red ink ribbon for this model.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:49.083
-Do you mind writing it in red?
-That won't be a problem.

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:53.374
Is there somewhere you can hide it?

01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:57.458
-Yes, I'll find a place.
-Don't take it lightly.

01:19:58.584 --> 01:20:03.124
I don't want my next article to be
about your disappearance!

01:20:03.209 --> 01:20:06.083
Nobody may know
that this typewriter exists!

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.499
-Is apartment really safe?
-Yes.

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:17.833
It's the only place left in the GDR
where I can say what I want.

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:21.083
Fine, then let's drink to that.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:25.749
This is the real stuff.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:32.749
To you. To letting all of Germany
see the true face of the GDR.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.041
Cheers.

01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:45.458
It's better than the Russian stuff.
To your success.

01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:07.124
-I must see Comrade Grubitz.
-Out of the question.

01:21:07.209 --> 01:21:12.208
-Do you know what we've invested...
-Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m...

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:14.958
Tell him that if he blows the cover,

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:19.083
we'll shut down the entire parish!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.583
He can call the Pope and complain!

01:21:23.084 --> 01:21:25.791
Okay, I've spent enough time
on this nonsense.

01:21:27.084 --> 01:21:28.999
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.

01:21:29.917 --> 01:21:31.791
I have to show you something.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:37.083
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists.

01:21:37.167 --> 01:21:39.999
"Based on Character Profile."
Pretty scientific, eh?

01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:42.541
And look at this.

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:49.791
"Dissertation Supervisor: A. Grubitz."
That's great, isn't it?

01:21:52.417 --> 01:21:54.458
I only gave him a B.

01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.833
They shouldn't think getting
a doctorate with me is easy.

01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:00.416
But this is first-class.

01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:04.791
Did you know that there are
just five types of artists?

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:08.624
Your guy, Dreyman, is a Type 4.

01:22:08.959 --> 01:22:11.624
A "hysterical anthropocentrist."

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:15.041
Can't bear being alone, always talking,
needing friends.

01:22:15.084 --> 01:22:18.749
That type should never be brought to trial.
They thrive on that.

01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:23.958
Temporary detention is
the best way to deal with them.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:27.416
Complete isolation and no set release date.

01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:31.291
No human contact the whole time,
not even with the guards.

01:22:31.417 --> 01:22:35.999
Good treatment, no harassment,
no abuse, no scandals,

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:38.666
nothing they could write about later.

01:22:39.625 --> 01:22:42.208
After 1 0 months, we release.

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:46.749
Suddenly, that guy won't
cause us any more trouble.

01:22:47.084 --> 01:22:48.958
Know what the best part is?

01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:52.708
Most Type 4s we've processed in this way

01:22:53.084 --> 01:22:58.624
never write anything again.
Or paint anything, or whatever artists do...

01:22:58.709 --> 01:23:01.958
And that without any use of force.
Just like that.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:04.083
Kind of

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:06.624
like a present.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.499
What brings you here?

01:23:09.834 --> 01:23:12.916
-Developments with Dreyman?
-That's why I'm here.

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:17.583
I think the time has come...

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:19.874
For what?

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:23.374
For us to slim down the operation.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.624
I don't want to run day and night shifts

01:23:28.084 --> 01:23:31.083
-for such an uncertain case.
-Uncertain, huh?

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.916
You don't think we'll find anything
for the Minister?

01:23:36.417 --> 01:23:38.666
Maybe if we're more flexible.

01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:42.583
If we watch "Lazlo"
outside his own four walls.

01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.083
Shall I give the case to Udo?

01:23:49.667 --> 01:23:51.749
I'd like to continue it myself.

01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:56.916
-Why?
-It could produce results.

01:23:58.459 --> 01:24:00.416
I just need to plan more flexibly.

01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:04.916
When I come and go, days and nights...

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.916
Maybe he's up to something outside.

01:24:13.917 --> 01:24:16.083
Something doesn't feel right here.

01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:21.249
There's something you're hiding.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:32.083
All right, I'll take Udo off the case.

01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:38.458
I can use him for this church case.
Give me a request in writing.

01:24:38.959 --> 01:24:42.249
Write as a reason, "Lack of suspicious acts."

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:48.333
And, Wiesler!

01:24:51.584 --> 01:24:55.083
A piece of advice for you:
We're not at school anymore.

01:24:55.584 --> 01:24:58.749
Projects aren't about grades, but success.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:21.333
"The state statistics office
counts everything, knows everything.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:26.749
"How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:32.749
"And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347."

01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:53.916
5:00 p.m. "Lazlo" reads the first act
of his anniversary play

01:25:53.959 --> 01:26:00.958
to Hauser and Wallner.

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:41.291
DENTAL PRACTICE

01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:49.249
-We're not writing a play, Christa.
-You don't have to tell me.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.333
-But I want to. It's a text...
-Don't tell me.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.458
Maybe I am as unreliable
as your friends say.

01:27:59.417 --> 01:28:00.583
But I...

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.749
I'm with you now.

01:28:04.084 --> 01:28:05.374
No matter what.

01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:44.916
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.416
said there is no quick fix

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.583
for saving damaged forests.

01:28:50.084 --> 01:28:52.541
East-West German relations under strain.

01:28:53.042 --> 01:28:55.874
Spiegel magazine today published

01:28:55.917 --> 01:28:59.874
a text by an unnamed East German author

01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:03.291
about suicide in
the German Democratic Republic.

01:29:03.792 --> 01:29:07.583
This follows a series of suicides
by prominent East-Berlin artists,

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:10.833
the latest being Albert Jerska.

01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:13.999
After being blacklisted for seven years,

01:29:14.084 --> 01:29:16.999
Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.

01:29:17.334 --> 01:29:19.916
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.166
any data relating to suicides.

01:29:22.584 --> 01:29:26.708
That year, Hungary was the only country
in Europe with a higher suicide rate.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.249
Yes, sir...

01:29:29.292 --> 01:29:33.624
You failed miserably, Grubitz,
you incompetent amateur!

01:29:33.792 --> 01:29:38.833
General, our man at the Spiegel
got us a Photostat of the original.

01:29:39.209 --> 01:29:41.458
Congratulations! So who wrote it?

01:29:41.584 --> 01:29:44.958
He doesn't know,
but using the typeface, we'll...

01:29:45.084 --> 01:29:47.208
You're hopeless! Get me names!

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:50.249
I will, as soon as we get the results.

01:29:50.292 --> 01:29:52.416
If not, you'll be put against the wall.

01:30:00.459 --> 01:30:02.166
Andrea, where's the graphologist?

01:30:02.417 --> 01:30:06.624
Thus I conclude that
it is a domestic typewriter,

01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:11.749
produced for export,
most likely a "Kolibri" travel model,

01:30:11.834 --> 01:30:16.124
made by the VEB Groma. If the ink
were black, I could be more precise.

01:30:18.292 --> 01:30:22.458
-Who owns such a typewriter?
-There are none registered in the GDR.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.083
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:29.874
Paul Hauser uses a "Valentino" typewriter,
made by Olivetti.

01:30:29.917 --> 01:30:32.499
That model has a more horizontal...

01:30:32.584 --> 01:30:34.124
Yes, yes! And Wallner?

01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:38.541
He writes on an Optima "Elite."

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:44.208
-Georg Dreyman?
-He writes his first drafts by hand,

01:30:44.542 --> 01:30:47.583
then types them up
on a Wanderer "Torpedo."

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:49.499
He's never used anything else.

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:55.749
How big is this Kolibri typewriter?

01:30:56.125 --> 01:30:59.249
It's one of the smallest available:

01:30:59.334 --> 01:31:02.833
1 9.5 cm x 9 cm x 1 9.5 cm.

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:06.249
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.

01:31:10.084 --> 01:31:11.666
Thank you. You may go.

01:31:16.084 --> 01:31:17.416
Goodbye, Comrade.

01:31:23.167 --> 01:31:26.833
GDR
THE SECRET SUICIDE STATISTICS

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.208
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler.

01:31:32.584 --> 01:31:38.583
4:00 p.m.
The group is exhausted

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:43.916
from so much writing.

01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:52.833
STAFF INTERNAL

01:31:55.917 --> 01:31:58.874
-Yes?
-Have you heard about this article?

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:01.416
-In the Spiegel? Yes.
-How so?

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:06.458
Hauser called Dreyman
and told him about it.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.624
Wiesler, this is very important.

01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:11.958
Both for my career and for yours.

01:32:12.917 --> 01:32:17.166
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?

01:32:18.667 --> 01:32:22.333
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No, nothing at all.

01:32:25.292 --> 01:32:30.916
A Spiegel editor crossed the border
using a false name on the 27th

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.333
and spent four hours here.
Real name: Gregor Hessenstein.

01:32:34.584 --> 01:32:38.458
Department VI followed him
to Prenzlauer Berg, then lost his trail.

01:32:38.917 --> 01:32:40.999
Did he have contact with Dreyman?

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:45.666
-Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
-Yes, of course.

01:32:46.834 --> 01:32:49.083
But I smell a writer behind this text.

01:32:49.334 --> 01:32:53.333
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.
So keep your ears open.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.041
Shit.

01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:19.833
Get in.

01:33:34.459 --> 01:33:38.791
If one of your staff deceives you,
you punish him, right?

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.083
-Sure, sure!
-Even a woman,

01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.833
-right?
-But of course.

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:50.416
Isn't everyone who serves a great man

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:52.416
part of his staff?

01:33:52.917 --> 01:33:57.249
You could see it like that...
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:04.041
This is where she gets her illegal
medication. Christa-Maria Sieland.

01:34:06.209 --> 01:34:08.791
You should know this, it's your department.

01:34:11.042 --> 01:34:13.999
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not,

01:34:15.375 --> 01:34:18.708
but I never want to see her
on a German stage again.

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:24.083
Now get out.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.249
Shut the door!

01:34:34.167 --> 01:34:37.624
Ms. Sieland? Please follow us.
We have some questions.

01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:42.416
Come along.

01:35:02.584 --> 01:35:03.666
So...

01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:08.708
Comrade Sieland,
a beautiful career you had, huh?

01:35:10.459 --> 01:35:12.333
A pity really. You were good.

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:14.916
You were very good indeed.

01:35:16.417 --> 01:35:18.083
Just too short-lived.

01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:21.124
Do have a seat.

01:35:28.584 --> 01:35:31.583
What do actors do
when they can't act anymore?

01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:37.791
Please...

01:35:40.209 --> 01:35:42.416
Isn't there anything I can do for you?

01:35:44.959 --> 01:35:48.249
For... State Security?

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:50.499
It's a little late for that.

01:35:52.334 --> 01:35:54.416
I know nearly all our artists.

01:35:54.834 --> 01:35:57.291
-I could find out a lot.
-I believe you.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.916
But it won't help you now.

01:36:10.584 --> 01:36:13.208
Maybe there's something else I could do?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.374
Something we might both find agreeable.

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.249
Unfortunately, you've made

01:36:24.084 --> 01:36:28.499
an enemy of a very powerful man.

01:36:29.584 --> 01:36:32.916
Therefore, I have less freedom
than would normally be the case.

01:36:35.584 --> 01:36:37.833
Is there no way I can save myself?

01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:41.083
I'm sorry, madam.

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:54.583
There is one possibility.

01:36:55.417 --> 01:36:57.958
Since you spend so much time with writers

01:36:58.625 --> 01:37:00.249
and artists...

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:07.083
You don't know anything about an article
from this week's Spiegel, do you?

01:37:07.167 --> 01:37:09.208
An article about suicide.

01:38:02.667 --> 01:38:04.416
State Security! Open the door!

01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:13.958
Open up!

01:38:19.334 --> 01:38:21.499
He's turned on the light in his study.

01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:24.499
Go in before he destroys any evidence.

01:38:25.084 --> 01:38:26.208
Crowbar!

01:38:29.917 --> 01:38:31.874
I don't think that'll be necessary.

01:38:33.042 --> 01:38:34.249
What's the matter, Comrades?

01:38:34.334 --> 01:38:37.583
We have a warrant to search the premises.

01:38:38.834 --> 01:38:41.208
-What are you looking for?
-It's confidential.

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:46.624
Boysen, Müller: bedroom.
Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:49.791
Heise and Thomas: living room, study. Go!

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.708
What do you burn in here?

01:39:44.167 --> 01:39:45.583
Substandard texts.

01:39:51.334 --> 01:39:53.208
A lot of Western literature, huh?

01:39:55.375 --> 01:39:57.666
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.

01:40:01.375 --> 01:40:04.083
-Status?
-All according to plan.

01:40:08.584 --> 01:40:12.874
We found nothing,
except Western books and newspapers.

01:40:15.667 --> 01:40:17.124
No trace to be found.

01:40:17.334 --> 01:40:18.916
Did you search thoroughly?

01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:20.916
Yes, Comrade.

01:40:21.042 --> 01:40:22.541
What's our next move?

01:40:28.625 --> 01:40:29.708
Comrade?

01:40:29.917 --> 01:40:31.333
Pull out your men.

01:40:33.625 --> 01:40:38.541
In the unlikely event that damage has
occurred, you may claim compensation.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:41.958
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:06.291
Yes?

01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:10.291
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you in
Hohenschönhausen at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:17.624
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:
It was Christa-Maria.

01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:20.791
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.

01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:24.958
It wasn't her.

01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:27.208
How can you be so sure?

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.083
You yourself said
she wasn't home last night.

01:41:34.209 --> 01:41:35.999
She knows the hiding place.

01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:39.083
Yes, she knows.

01:41:45.667 --> 01:41:48.666
So if you're right,
and the search was due to her,

01:41:49.875 --> 01:41:51.833
then she's our guardian angel.

01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:59.999
I'm here to see Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz.

01:42:01.084 --> 01:42:02.458
Captain Wiesler.

01:42:03.209 --> 01:42:04.916
Interrogation Room 76.

01:42:22.167 --> 01:42:23.666
Yes! Come in.

01:42:28.584 --> 01:42:29.833
Sit down.

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:38.083
So?

01:42:41.584 --> 01:42:43.166
What was that about?

01:42:43.334 --> 01:42:45.499
You're asking me what that was about?

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.958
What do you suspect Dreyman of?

01:42:52.334 --> 01:42:54.249
He wrote the Spiegel article.

01:42:58.917 --> 01:43:00.249
Who alleges that?

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.499
Come with me.

01:43:16.125 --> 01:43:17.208
Here.

01:43:19.917 --> 01:43:23.374
I don't know how you could be so sloppy
as to miss all of this.

01:43:24.584 --> 01:43:27.416
But I know you differently,
especially as an interrogator.

01:43:28.084 --> 01:43:30.124
So I'm giving you one last chance.

01:43:31.417 --> 01:43:33.333
Bring in prisoner 662, now.

01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:40.416
Are you still on the right side?

01:43:44.584 --> 01:43:47.249
-Yes.
-Then don't screw it up again.

01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:14.166
Shall I restrain the prisoner?

01:44:15.042 --> 01:44:17.624
No, she's an informant now. You may go.

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:26.666
So you're my commanding officer?

01:44:27.334 --> 01:44:28.374
Write.

01:44:29.292 --> 01:44:30.624
Then command me.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.416
In another 1 0 hours...

01:44:50.334 --> 01:44:52.249
No, in nine and a half...

01:44:53.542 --> 01:44:58.541
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that
you, for health reasons, cannot appear.

01:45:00.584 --> 01:45:03.958
And that will be your last mention
in the acting world.

01:45:06.042 --> 01:45:07.583
Is that what you want?

01:45:10.334 --> 01:45:12.833
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.

01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:18.249
There is no evidence, and no typewriter.

01:45:18.417 --> 01:45:19.749
I made it all up.

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.708
I hope not.

01:45:24.209 --> 01:45:26.291
If so, we'll have to keep you here.

01:45:27.375 --> 01:45:31.541
A false statement is perjury,
which carries around two years in prison.

01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:36.833
Dreyman will go to prison anyway

01:45:37.417 --> 01:45:39.333
on account of your statement

01:45:41.417 --> 01:45:44.624
and the material
we've already found in the apartment.

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.624
Save yourself, at least.

01:45:53.042 --> 01:45:57.249
You have no idea how many people
are in jail here for senseless heroics.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.749
Don't forget your audience.

01:46:03.417 --> 01:46:07.083
"Don't forget your audience."
He has some funny ideas.

01:46:12.042 --> 01:46:14.708
Don't forget
what the state has done for you...

01:46:16.834 --> 01:46:18.416
Your whole life long.

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:22.708
Now you can do something for the state.
And it will thank you.

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.749
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.

01:46:31.125 --> 01:46:32.958
Dreyman will never find out.

01:46:33.917 --> 01:46:35.749
I'll let you go immediately,

01:46:36.292 --> 01:46:38.583
and we'll strike
only after you're back with him.

01:46:40.542 --> 01:46:43.249
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.

01:46:45.292 --> 01:46:47.458
And tonight you'll be back on stage.

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.833
In your element.

01:46:54.375 --> 01:46:56.083
In front of your audience.

01:47:05.667 --> 01:47:07.624
Tell me where the documents are.

01:47:18.334 --> 01:47:19.583
Where are they?

01:47:24.334 --> 01:47:26.166
They're in the apartment.

01:47:29.250 --> 01:47:30.749
Under the doorsill,

01:47:32.375 --> 01:47:34.083
between the living room

01:47:35.834 --> 01:47:37.208
and the hallway.

01:47:40.292 --> 01:47:41.708
You can remove it.

01:47:56.834 --> 01:47:58.208
Is this where you mean?

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.583
Mark the exact place with a cross.

01:48:30.917 --> 01:48:34.916
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.

01:48:34.959 --> 01:48:38.833
That means responsibilities,
like conspiracy and confidentiality,

01:48:38.917 --> 01:48:42.333
but also privileges...

01:49:05.625 --> 01:49:06.749
Guard!

01:49:07.959 --> 01:49:12.249
-Call Wiesler for me.
-Colonel Wiesler has left the premises.

01:49:12.417 --> 01:49:13.583
I see.

01:49:16.042 --> 01:49:17.624
All right. Stand down.

01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:37.416
What does a rider do when he's thrown?
He gets back on again.

01:49:38.334 --> 01:49:42.874
Go inside. Sleep it off. What happened
has nothing to do with the house.

01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.124
No, but with the whole country.

01:50:51.584 --> 01:50:52.583
Christa!

01:50:52.667 --> 01:50:56.291
Stop, I was at Kerschners'
and they had no water. I need a shower.

01:51:15.542 --> 01:51:17.583
You were in a hurry to get here.

01:51:17.667 --> 01:51:20.249
-Operation "Lazlo" is still in progress.
-Are they both inside?

01:51:20.334 --> 01:51:21.374
Yes.

01:51:23.292 --> 01:51:24.874
Here's today's report.

01:51:25.667 --> 01:51:28.791
The last report for Operation "Lazlo."

01:51:50.542 --> 01:51:53.416
-Why didn't you call me?
-What?

01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.833
Why didn't you call me?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.708
I was out in the country.

01:52:01.917 --> 01:52:03.833
Can you hand me the nail brush?

01:52:09.042 --> 01:52:11.749
The Stasi was here.
They searched the apartment.

01:52:13.084 --> 01:52:14.291
Who was here?

01:52:16.542 --> 01:52:18.166
State Security! Open up!

01:52:19.417 --> 01:52:20.499
Stay here.

01:52:29.417 --> 01:52:30.416
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.916
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz
from State Security.

01:52:33.334 --> 01:52:36.958
I just wanted to make sure
they did a thorough job last night.

01:52:37.209 --> 01:52:39.458
Your study? We'll start there.

01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:51.583
Men, search carefully
for notes hidden in the books.

01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:12.916
Oh, what do we have here?

01:53:15.959 --> 01:53:18.333
This doorsill doesn't look kosher to me.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.124
Could it be a secret compartment?

01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:43.416
Let her go. She's not a suspect.

01:53:59.417 --> 01:54:00.666
The actress...

01:54:32.667 --> 01:54:36.083
I was too weak. I can never put right

01:54:36.125 --> 01:54:38.791
-what I've done wrong.
-There's nothing to put right!

01:54:38.917 --> 01:54:41.749
You understand? Nothing. I moved the...

01:54:53.334 --> 01:54:58.708
Forgive me, forgive me...

01:55:29.042 --> 01:55:32.416
Take your men back to headquarters.
This mission is over.

01:55:47.834 --> 01:55:50.333
I've concluded the mission,
Comrade Dreyman.

01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:54.249
We must have received an erroneous tip-off.
Sorry.

01:55:57.542 --> 01:55:58.583
Come on.

01:56:58.417 --> 01:57:01.208
There's one thing
you should understand, Wiesler.

01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:03.749
Your career is over.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.749
Even if you were too smart
to leave any traces.

01:57:09.417 --> 01:57:13.958
You'll end up in some cellar,
steam-opening letters until you retire.

01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:16.583
That means the next 20 years.

01:57:17.167 --> 01:57:18.374
20 years.

01:57:20.417 --> 01:57:21.916
That's a long time.

01:57:31.542 --> 01:57:33.583
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV ELECTED
AS LEADER

01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:35.583
OF THE SOVIET UNION'S
COMMUNIST PARTY

01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:41.583
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER

01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:01.791
The Wall has come down.

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.583
Yes, the Wall has come down.

01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:17.916
The border guards have opened the gates.
The excitement is enormous!

01:58:18.125 --> 01:58:21.416
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!

01:58:21.792 --> 01:58:26.708
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989,
will go down in history!

01:58:26.917 --> 01:58:29.249
A young family stands in front of me...

01:58:52.042 --> 01:58:54.749
TWO YEARS LATER

01:58:58.834 --> 01:59:01.249
What's wrong, my child?

01:59:02.167 --> 01:59:03.916
Your Arthur is dead.

01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:08.374
Arthur...

01:59:09.584 --> 01:59:13.499
Can't you be wrong, just this once?
I saw him this morning!

01:59:13.917 --> 01:59:17.083
No, sister. Believe me. He fell to his death.

01:59:18.667 --> 01:59:21.208
The loyal men surround him, as you do me,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.083
and despite the high sun,

01:59:24.167 --> 01:59:28.208
cast seven shadows
on his noble dead body.

01:59:29.375 --> 01:59:31.499
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

01:59:32.417 --> 01:59:33.666
I see it,

01:59:34.167 --> 01:59:36.374
though I'd rather see any other horror.

01:59:39.417 --> 01:59:41.833
Why am I not spared these visions?

01:59:43.584 --> 01:59:47.416
Elena! Go home and mourn.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.416
I will finish your shift.

02:00:00.042 --> 02:00:01.874
Too many memories, huh?

02:00:06.917 --> 02:00:08.916
I couldn't stay in there either.

02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:13.833
But what's this I hear?

02:00:14.917 --> 02:00:17.249
You've not written since the Wall fell?

02:00:18.417 --> 02:00:19.749
That's not good.

02:00:21.625 --> 02:00:23.791
After all our country invested in you.

02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:27.458
Although I understand you, Dreyman.

02:00:28.209 --> 02:00:30.749
What is there to write about
in this new Germany?

02:00:31.584 --> 02:00:35.083
Nothing to believe in,
nothing to rebel against...

02:00:39.125 --> 02:00:41.291
Life was good in our little Republic.

02:00:42.292 --> 02:00:44.083
Many people only realize that now.

02:00:45.167 --> 02:00:48.916
-There is one thing I do need to ask you.
-Whatever you want.

02:00:49.917 --> 02:00:51.666
Why was I never under surveillance?

02:00:53.417 --> 02:00:54.666
Everyone else was.

02:00:55.042 --> 02:00:56.166
Why not me?

02:01:02.417 --> 02:01:04.166
You were under full surveillance.

02:01:05.542 --> 02:01:07.124
We knew everything about you.

02:01:08.584 --> 02:01:09.916
Full surveillance?

02:01:11.292 --> 02:01:12.833
Every inch was bugged.

02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:14.916
The full program.

02:01:16.042 --> 02:01:17.041
Impossible.

02:01:19.917 --> 02:01:22.249
Take a look behind your light switches.

02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:24.708
We knew everything.

02:01:26.834 --> 02:01:29.749
We knew that you couldn't give

02:01:30.167 --> 02:01:32.249
our little Christa what she needed.

02:01:38.417 --> 02:01:41.416
To think that people like you
once ruled a country...

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.249
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL

02:03:12.250 --> 02:03:13.416
Visitors Welcome

02:03:18.917 --> 02:03:23.249
It'll be a moment, there should be
more than one file in your case.

02:04:07.375 --> 02:04:11.083
I ordered them chronologically.
Old ones at the top

02:04:11.292 --> 02:04:13.249
and the newer ones underneath.

02:04:14.584 --> 02:04:15.749
My respects.

02:04:33.834 --> 02:04:35.833
OPERATION "LAZLO"

02:04:38.375 --> 02:04:41.208
Operation "Lazlo," subject: Georg Dreyman,

02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:43.249
code name: "Lazlo," is launched.

02:04:43.917 --> 02:04:47.083
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.

02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:51.833
"Lazlo" takes delivery

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:56.249
of a daily Western newspaper
without official permission.

02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:59.833
I suggest not taking any action

02:05:00.084 --> 02:05:02.749
so as not to arouse suspicion
of surveillance.

02:05:04.542 --> 02:05:06.916
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents,

02:05:07.375 --> 02:05:09.416
then presumably have intercourse.

02:05:19.584 --> 02:05:23.249
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle
from West Berlin.

02:05:23.917 --> 02:05:26.083
They tell him about a play

02:05:26.125 --> 02:05:30.291
that Hauser and "Lazlo" will write
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

02:05:34.459 --> 02:05:37.333
We expect further information on the play,

02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:39.416
a plot summary, etc.

02:05:41.875 --> 02:05:43.666
Contents of first act:

02:05:44.625 --> 02:05:46.833
Lenin is in constant danger.

02:05:47.459 --> 02:05:51.833
Despite increasing external pressure,
he sticks to his revolutionary plans.

02:05:54.084 --> 02:05:55.874
Lenin is exhausted.

02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:04.083
HGW...

02:06:06.167 --> 02:06:08.166
HGW XX/7...

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.166
I, Christa-Maria Sieland,

02:06:24.584 --> 02:06:26.791
freely commit myself to work unofficially

02:06:26.875 --> 02:06:29.833
for State Security.

02:06:30.542 --> 02:06:33.124
This decision is the result
of my conviction that...

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:42.916
Georg Dreyman wrote the Spiegel article,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.999
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."

02:06:45.084 --> 02:06:47.916
His accomplices were
the journalist Paul Hauser...

02:06:57.250 --> 02:07:00.499
Christa-Maria Sieland was
arrested on March 10th

02:07:00.584 --> 02:07:03.791
for drug abuse,
on Minister Hempf's indication.

02:07:04.459 --> 02:07:07.499
She was released at 1:50 p.m.
on March 1 1th,

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.833
having revealed "Lazlo's" hiding place

02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:14.833
and signing up as informant "Marta."

02:07:20.542 --> 02:07:21.958
1:50 p.m...

02:07:24.417 --> 02:07:25.666
So when did she...

02:07:25.959 --> 02:07:30.333
After the unsuccessful house search
of March 11, 1985

02:07:30.875 --> 02:07:33.041
and "Marta's" fatal accident,

02:07:33.292 --> 02:07:35.291
Operation "Lazlo" was terminated.

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:43.749
Note: HGW's promotion ban
takes effect immediately.

02:07:44.250 --> 02:07:47.624
Transfer to Department M,
with the recommendation

02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:51.166
not to entrust him with missions
under his sole responsibility.

02:07:53.042 --> 02:07:57.583
10:50 a.m.: Resume surveillance
outside "Lazlo's" house.

02:08:00.584 --> 02:08:02.958
At 3:10 p.m., "Marta" comes directly

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:05.708
from Hohenschönhausen to his apartment.

02:08:05.917 --> 02:08:08.541
House search and report to follow.

02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:11.749
End of Operation "Lazlo."

02:08:11.834 --> 02:08:14.541
HGW, 3:15 p.m.

02:08:32.625 --> 02:08:34.249
Who is HGW XX/7?

02:09:19.625 --> 02:09:20.666
Stop.

02:10:11.917 --> 02:10:13.583
Back to Hufeland Street.

02:10:39.084 --> 02:10:41.916
TWO YEARS LATER

02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:52.416
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN

02:11:11.334 --> 02:11:12.374
Hello.

02:11:20.084 --> 02:11:27.083
GEORG DREYMAN
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:33.666
A NOVEL

02:11:35.084 --> 02:11:39.499
DEDICATED TO HGW XX/7,
IN GRATITUDE.

02:11:58.917 --> 02:12:00.124
29.80.

02:12:01.042 --> 02:12:02.583
Shall I gift-wrap it?
