00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.523
Let’s talk about conflict.

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:21.715
This is an element of drama

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:26.326
that’s usually taken for granted.

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:27.394
Although

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:33.192
we’re aware of it
even if we don’t identify it.

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:39.580
We can tell if the conflict
development is good

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:47.057
when it draws the audience
to watch the play.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.495
Why?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.077
If the character’s
objective is clear,

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:54.804
then the obstacle
should be clear as well.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.054
Character equals objective.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:04.062
Conflict equals obstacle.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.697
So, objective and obstacle

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:11.465
and the interplay between the two.

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:17.000
Whatever the character does
to achieve the objective,

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.436
she has to go through

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.087
a lot of challenges.

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:25.761
That’s the obstacle.

00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:32.509
The story becomes
nerve-wracking or very interesting

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.424
and very suspenseful
because of those two things.

00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:41.069
When you remove the obstacle,

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:43.621
it’ll be easy for the character
to achieve her objective.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.426
And she won’t learn much from it
if she easily attains it.

00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:49.572
But when you put too many hurdles,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.578
the character might die or give up
because she’s unable to cope.

00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:04.603
Those two are completely
valid conclusions for your story.

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:08.437
But that depends on
what you want to say

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.229
and the effect
you want to have.

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:18.608
If we'll pity the character
or understand all she's gone through,

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:22.636
that despite overcoming those hardships,
she still died.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.141
We could either pity
or understand the character.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.812
Or in the case of comedy,

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.968
we could laugh at the situation

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:38.931
or celebrate with the character.

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:42.962
It's easy to talk about it

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:46.831
but difficult to do

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:50.705
because you have to look
for the right situation.

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.698
You need to look
for an appropriate situation

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:58.703
and context where the audience
doesn't have to wonder,

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.232
"Why'd that happen?"

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:03.281
It's just like watching boxing, right?

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:06.568
When you're knocked out, it's over.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:10.192
There’s nothing else to it.
It’s over.

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.113
But probably because

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:16.174
you don’t provide an obstacle

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:21.212
that your character may
or may not be able to hurdle.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:26.949
If the obstacle's so big that...

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:29.988
she can't handle it,

00:03:30.058 --> 00:03:34.385
then she won't be
able to show her character,

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.478
her mettle to persevere.

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:41.087
It has to be at a certain point

00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.725
where the audience
is also uncertain

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.483
if she can make it or not.

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.204
It must be formidable enough—

00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.180
because if the conflict's too small,

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.562
the story ends immediately
because it’s easily resolved.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:04:00.994
It has to be formidable enough
for her to sacrifice

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.900
an important part
of her life or of her character.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:13.196
So that if she ever achieves
what she wants,

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:17.631
there's a scar.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.016
She also lost something.

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:26.816
She needs to give something away,
to let go of something.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.940
Those are the things
that'll make it interesting.

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:37.178
Again, the logic is realistic in mode.

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:42.209
What I want to tackle

00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:50.258
is how to look at conflict
in different ways.

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:54.293
Back in high school,
we'd always say

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.461
that there are different
kinds of conflict:

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:02.928
man against man,

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:04.324
two people fighting,

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.630
man against himself,
man against nature.

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:13.345
For a reader,
this may be easy to understand.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.970
But for a writer who wants
to make plays for the stage,

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:24.280
the next question would be,
"So what now?"

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.144
"How will this help my writing?"

00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:33.466
I have different ways
of looking at conflict.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.730
It might help you

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:41.190
in approaching how to
set up these obstacles.

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:44.918
The first approach
is the simplest one.

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:51.437
Conflict arises when one character

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.233
and another want the same thing.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:06:00.195
Whether it's love, gold,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:10.158
oil mine, presidency,
or boxing championship,

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.671
these two characters
want the same thing.

00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:18.728
And because they only want one thing,
only one person can have it.

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:20.107
Definitely,

00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:31.109
they're going to fight
until someone gets that one thing.

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:36.502
That’s the simplest
or most basic.

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:41.163
Another approach is the conflict

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.171
that arises within oneself.

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.211
How does that happen?

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:53.306
This isn't just conflict with yourself
where you're talking to yourself, no.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.629
But depending on the situation,
it's usually a conflict between

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.832
two identities of the same person.

00:07:02.717 --> 00:07:07.427
One identity could be a teacher

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:09.911
and the other could be

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:13.049
a gay lover.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.542
And these identities

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.931
could reach a point

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.901
where one has to be sacrificed.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.224
Especially if, for example,

00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:35.466
there’s a scandal.

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:40.449
Her reputation as a teacher
could go down.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:46.542
So, these two identities of the character

00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:49.194
have to be weighed.

00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:52.931
She has to weigh

00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:57.568
which one she’ll let go.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.552
It's painful for the character.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:09.127
But that's clearer compared to saying
man is against himself, right?

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:17.199
We’re usually forced to choose

00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:20.810
depending on where we are.

00:08:21.436 --> 00:08:27.914
Will I resign from this job
because I want to be an artist?

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:33.832
Despite always talking about
how will we earn?

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:39.752
So the clash between those
two identities will force you to choose just one.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.652
For example, again,

00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:47.665
the only example
I could think of now,

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:51.883
I don't know why it's always Macbeth,

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:55.155
but it's about his loyalty to the king.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.563
He’s loyal to the king,

00:08:56.625 --> 00:09:00.040
and the possibility
of him becoming king.

00:09:00.554 --> 00:09:05.255
Those are the two roles in his life.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:13.203
It has come to a point
where one must give way to the other.

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:18.777
'Cause his loyalty to the king
is not a desire, it’s a duty.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:26.161
Then comes this stimulation
where he could be king.

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:30.756
If you look at it from that set-up,
from that context,

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:35.280
is he doing what he's preaching?

00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:39.114
He's subjected to a test.

00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:46.663
These kinds of conflict,

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:52.179
usually have something to do
with being authentic, with being whole.

00:09:52.688 --> 00:09:57.749
The character
being whole, being unified.

00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:01.954
This is where she's forced to lie,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:06.580
to herself and to others.

00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:17.032
That's what you have to put
your character through,

00:10:17.114 --> 00:10:20.538
where her stability collapses

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:24.895
because she wants something.

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:27.780
But what she wants
might exact a price

00:10:27.863 --> 00:10:32.716
that she'll have to...

00:10:33.882 --> 00:10:37.031
give way for her other role.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.778
Just like character,

00:10:39.914 --> 00:10:46.347
conflicts have a heavy
implication if you look for it.

00:10:47.387 --> 00:10:53.187
And eventually, ultimately,
it's built on what you want to say.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.220
Is this just about infidelity?

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:02.026
Or is that conflict

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:07.957
also a metaphor
for a deeper problem?

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.348
Let's not go anymore to
the topic of being gay

00:11:11.443 --> 00:11:16.043
because sometimes
coming out is like peeling onion layers.

00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:17.862
I may come out to you

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.042
but I may not be out
in another context.

00:11:26.412 --> 00:11:30.339
For one reason or another,
when you write it and those two clash,

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:33.157
the character
will be forced to choose.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.481
That's usually
the interesting kind of conlict

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:44.694
because it's not just
full of action or catfights

00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:46.215
just because they want the same thing.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.255
“No, I want this.”
“No, I want that.”

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:51.086
That's one level.

00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:54.996
Another level
is when you're forced to...

00:11:55.861 --> 00:12:00.801
to weigh things and you may
have to give up or lose something.

00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:04.243
Another way of looking at conflict

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:05.942
would be...

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:10.528
to look at...

00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:15.566
the status
of each character.

00:12:18.103 --> 00:12:21.677
This is a bit hard to explain,
but I'll try.

00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:23.866
Humans...

00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:25.959
are like dogs.

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:30.324
We're very conscious
of hierarchy,

00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:33.518
of status.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:39.802
Even when we don't say it,
we can feel it and gauge it.

00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:43.614
Even when we walk on the streets
and there's a narrow road,

00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:47.126
the person who'll give way

00:12:47.174 --> 00:12:52.492
is in effect lowering his status
to let the other person pass.

00:12:52.791 --> 00:12:56.927
That's how we are,
always negotiating our status.

00:12:57.369 --> 00:13:00.075
If I'm a teacher,

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:03.161
I'd have a higher status
than the students.

00:13:03.186 --> 00:13:08.125
They'd call me sir

00:13:08.382 --> 00:13:10.557
or say 'po'.

00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:15.723
Not just because of my age,
but because of my position as a teacher.

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:20.974
But in other situations,
I'd be the one saying 'po'.

00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.848
I'd be the one saying sir.

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:27.124
Even to security guards.

00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:34.769
Or to the manager of a company
I’m coaxing to accept me.

00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:37.392
Or to a producer.

00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:44.336
You will hear how I humble myself
from the tone of my voice.

00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:45.701
And you will also hear

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:49.241
how domineering she sounds
from the tone of her voice.

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:57.138
So with each line, each dialogue
the character utters,

00:13:57.224 --> 00:13:59.157
she's establishing something.

00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:03.161
Whether she knows it or not,
she's establishing her status.

00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:06.716
This status negotiation shows

00:14:06.807 --> 00:14:10.500
where the story's headed

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:13.309
in order for the character
to get what she wants.

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:17.406
There are many strategies
regarding status.

00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:20.684
In any scene that you write...

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:23.934
If you look back
on the scenes you’ve written,

00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:30.043
almost unconsciously,
they are negotiations for status.

00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:34.395
And it doesn't mean
it's just as simple as

00:14:34.504 --> 00:14:39.625
putting yourself on a higher
status to achieve what you want.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.711
Sometimes,

00:14:40.773 --> 00:14:44.164
the character’s strategy
is to put herself on a lower status

00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:45.875
to get what she wants.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.306
Characters who are asslickers.

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:56.159
Usually when her superior laughs,
she laughs as well.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.826
Once you master

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:08.749
the understanding of
this psychological phenomenon of humans,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.115
you can play with it.

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:14.088
There are strategies
to get what they want.

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.192
And sometimes,

00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:19.788
people are blind to it

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:25.052
that it determines
their downfall.

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:29.700
She got blindsided.
Something like that.

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:34.275
That's the stuff of tragedy, right?

00:15:34.562 --> 00:15:37.453
She has a tragic flaw.
She didn't see.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.700
That puts her down
and elevates the other.

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.333
Ultimately,
the most impactful way

00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:52.374
to show the conflict of status changes

00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:59.374
is through a reversal in the entire play.

00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:04.011
When Cinderella who was oppressed
in the beginning

00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:05.931
becomes a princess in the end,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.836
there's a reversal of status.

00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:11.482
But it's not just about fortune.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:15.156
That's also what happened
to Macbeth,

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.168
wherein he

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.826
used to serve the king,

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:25.127
but rose to prominence
when he killed the king.

00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:27.907
And in the end,

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:30.821
he also fell down hard.

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:36.443
So any form of reversal in status
will create the same impact.

00:16:36.599 --> 00:16:38.087
And you can only do that

00:16:38.216 --> 00:16:42.965
when you look at conflict
as a negotiation of status.

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:50.375
If you think nothing's happening,
and the banters just go on,

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.087
it's probably because

00:16:52.817 --> 00:16:57.361
there's no
status development happening.

00:16:57.418 --> 00:17:00.113
It's either there's a reversal
or it's just static like this.

00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:02.660
Sometimes a piece of evidence

00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:04.355
will suddenly

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.819
reverse the status of characters.

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:09.419
And it’s got something
to do with conflict

00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:14.169
because all these
status negotiations of characters

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:21.712
refer to whether the character
will be able to get

00:17:21.996 --> 00:17:23.884
what he or she wants or not

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:25.403
and at what price.

00:17:27.107 --> 00:17:33.518
With every character
in a three-character play,

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:42.183
let's say one’s a supporting character

00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:46.430
to attain the objective
of the first character,

00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:49.693
would it still be interesting

00:17:49.718 --> 00:17:59.353
to have status negotiation
in their relationship?

00:18:00.629 --> 00:18:02.458
Even when she's supporting
the other character?

00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:02.886
- Yes.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.708
Yes.

00:18:06.872 --> 00:18:09.618
I'm sure the third character
also wants something.

00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:11.980
The supporting character

00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:19.199
must also want something.

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:24.505
What's great about that is
if you shake the situation,

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:28.943
you'll see that they
might not always be in sync

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.452
with each other.

00:18:31.664 --> 00:18:34.987
So there'll be trust issues,
for example,

00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:39.508
which may be different
from the other one.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:45.006
They could be allies
when the third character is there.

00:18:45.084 --> 00:18:48.506
But when the third isn't there,
they could be in conflict with each other.

00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:51.856
That could be interesting.

00:18:54.379 --> 00:18:58.793
The reversal of that could be
the other character siding with the third.

00:18:59.627 --> 00:19:02.306
There are a lot
of configurations you can do.

00:19:03.034 --> 00:19:05.368
Even if you just think about

00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:11.164
the character's status trajectory

00:19:12.508 --> 00:19:13.998
to get what she wants.

00:19:14.807 --> 00:19:19.715
It's also good to identify
what conflict is occurring?

00:19:21.382 --> 00:19:24.123
Of course, before that,
you have to ask,

00:19:24.156 --> 00:19:26.283
"What does this character want?"

00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.474
"Why can't she get it?"

00:19:30.428 --> 00:19:32.957
When the obstacle isn't clear,

00:19:33.683 --> 00:19:38.907
then maybe that's what's dragging
the conflict or the play.

00:19:39.103 --> 00:19:41.752
Because the conflict isn't clear.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.157
The hurdle you put
before the character

00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:48.940
to achieve what she
wants isn't clear enough.

00:19:50.698 --> 00:19:55.040
That tight relationship
between objective and obstacle

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:57.987
is what will develop

00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:05.501
and intensify the situation

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:11.722
which, in turn, will
keep the audience glued

00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:14.179
to what will happen next.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.586
So that's it.

00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:19.351
That's conflict.
