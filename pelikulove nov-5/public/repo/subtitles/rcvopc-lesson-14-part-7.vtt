00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.348
I have a suspicion
that audience development-wise

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:19.439
it won't be a problem
in the province compared to Manila.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:25.781
The challenge of the regions,
the provinces is content

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.137
for their audiences.

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:33.359
Because if you go to an outreach,
like what our regional groups do--

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:37.187
there are actually a lot,
thousands of people who want to watch.

00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:38.466
What's important

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:44.044
is how to introduce
these kinds of new content

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:50.802
to the audiences so they continue
to support these kinds of works.

00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:52.536
There are writers to begin with.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.825
Ah, so the writers
will really come from--

00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:58.341
From the region.

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.675
Second, you should have
a group of actors.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.091
Because it's necessary
to have actors and directors in VLF.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:11.555
If you can pinpoint 2 or 3 directors,
maybe start with that

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:12.806
and a few of the--

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:17.780
Don't be too ambitious
about doing it in a big scale

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.244
because VLF started like that.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:21.900
It started really small
and then it grew.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.951
The venue is an important thing as well.

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.432
Space is always important for artists,
which we also lack.

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:37.499
Honestly, I think the reason for VLF's success
is because we have CCP as the venue.

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:43.267
There's a black box made available
year in and year out

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.632
and there are rehearsal spaces.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080
That's important.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.647
Whatever's there in the region,

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:52.682
it's important to
secure the spaces

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:58.107
where artists are given space
to develop and create and innovate.

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:01.831
When it gets tough,
we could always rely on technology.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:04.108
We could make use of livestream.

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:09.122
One of our successful endeavors,
we call it arts education.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.232
Arts online.

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:15.490
We invite experts like you

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:19.240
to speak before a live
classroom audience at the CCP

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:23.275
but it's streaming
to 4-5 classrooms all over the country.

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:24.957
Live.

00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:27.649
- They can even like--
- Ask questions.

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:29.888
It’s simple.
Wi-fi, that’s what you need.

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:32.615
One camera and a contact

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.583
who'll say “Okay, at this time
we’re going to stream,”

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.622
and hopefully,
the wi-fi doesn’t fail.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.404
And you know,
it has a wide reach.

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:50.813
You have a live coverage
usually on events like those at CCP.

00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:53.982
You can immediately reach
30 people live in front of you.

00:02:54.094 --> 00:03:00.263
But if you have five classrooms,
and it has 50 people per classroom,

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:01.747
you already have 250 as audience.

00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:04.755
300 in a one hour
or two hour event,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.169
very low cost,
but high impact

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.780
I just want to add,

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:13.808
with regards to Virgin Labfest,
when it started

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.777
it seemed like
a chicken-and-egg situation.

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:20.263
"There aren't any playwrights
because nobody likes to showcase them,"

00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:21.751
Where will you start?

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:27.948
Even with VLF, we didn't start
with a “call for submission”

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:33.308
because nobody would submit,
nobody really knew it existed.

00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:37.352
We curated available works first,

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:39.916
and not all of them were good.

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:43.707
I mean it was really--
do you remember that?

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.554
You undressed there.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.603
It became popular because of her.

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:59.704
She was the virgin offering

00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:03.453
in the whole "Sister Outlaw".

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:08.877
People gained interest
because of that.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.628
I think the next thing
is regularity.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:18.013
We repeated it every year
until people started to look forward to it.

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:23.315
We only started calling
for submissions on the fourth year

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.205
because that was the time

00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:30.873
the audience recognized
they could write as well.

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:34.757
- That's when it started to roll.
- May I share a small tidbit

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:39.727
that may be exciting
for the VLF participants?

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:49.177
I just met a young architect recently
and he said he saw VLF,

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:52.132
I asked him how
since he was an architect.

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.930
You know how he watched VLF?

00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:57.888
His father always
dragged him to watch.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:04.249
His father flew in from Davao
and watched VLF every year.

00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:07.993
He goes to watch
and drags his children with him.

00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:10.485
There's also one
from Ilocos Norte.

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:11.842
Cool dad.

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:14.237
And his dad
is in his sixties.

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:15.297
That's cool.

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:19.589
Because he really felt
VLF shows very interesting stories.

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.192
And he lines up.

00:05:22.257 --> 00:05:25.437
Now all his children know about VLF.

00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:28.328
So it took like four...

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:29.845
14 years.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.156
This just means
87
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:12,159
you really have to nurture
your audience.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.743
you really have to nurture
your audience.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.768
It's about making them go back

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.213
for the experience--

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.880
First, they have to enjoy the experience

00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:44.043
Okay.

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:50.931
I just want to tell you in this last episode

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:55.486
the writing of any play
never stops with the first draft.

00:05:55.553 --> 00:06:00.753
And in fact, if I push the whole thing
it never stops even after production

00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:04.310
because what you wrote
always comes back to you.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:08.738
If you liked the production,
your play's enriched and you're happy.

00:06:08.857 --> 00:06:11.999
Even if you disliked the production,
it'll always come back to you.

00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:14.288
And another
opportunity will open

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:17.597
for you to find another theme
to produce, display,

00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:20.800
and it could never end
like Chris Millado's play.

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:26.002
Even after so many years,
it keeps coming back with a new life.

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:30.973
Once you’ve written it,
it will never cease to grow

00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:32.434
until you abandon it.

00:06:32.878 --> 00:06:37.707
To paraphrase Joseph Conrad,
"The work is never finished, it’s only abandoned."

00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:45.013
It's up to you how
to strengthen or nurture it.

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:48.096
Thank you, everyone!

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:49.260
- Thank you.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.862
You're supposed to be graduates
because this is the final episode.

00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.483
And thank you very much

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.289
for joining me.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:05.019
Whatever journey you take
in writing your play,

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:09.326
I'll be waiting
to read your work!

00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:16.051
You also have the opportunity
to continue this course.

00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:20.014
I expect you to write something
and when you're done,

00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:27.437
you can submit it to a special group
and talk about it there.

00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:30.631
What we call
the Writers' Block online.

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:33.853
If you're not based in Manila,

00:07:33.878 --> 00:07:39.333
or don't have the chance
to attend our sessions,

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:44.464
This'll be the venue
where you can submit your works.

00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:49.441
And we'll be the first members
of the Writers' Block online.

00:07:49.563 --> 00:07:56.568
They'll be ready to help you,
and read and give feedback to your work.

00:07:57.898 --> 00:08:00.072
We'll be waiting
for your masterpieces!

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:04.107
And possibly, indirectly,
they might wait for you, too!

00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:05.993
You never know.

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:15.690
They might read it and find it
exciting enough to produce.

00:08:18.182 --> 00:08:19.182
On that note,

00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:24.241
they were able to produce
a lot of things here at the course.

00:08:24.427 --> 00:08:27.980
Maybe it'd be good
to send it to them

00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:30.592
For them to read it.
You never know.

00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:33.250
It could go somewhere.

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:39.465
You should keep on submitting
your script and see where it goes.

00:08:40.746 --> 00:08:43.328
Thank you!

00:08:43.487 --> 00:08:45.074
- Thank you.
